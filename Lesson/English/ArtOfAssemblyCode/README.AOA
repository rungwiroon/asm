RPTEDIT Word Processing Program.

This package includes a simple word processing program (RPTEDIT.EXE) that
allows you to prepare laboratory reports in the event you do not have
access to another word processor.  This program was written with Borland
Delphi using the Visual Solutions Pack.  Unfortunately, Borland's
License agreement does not allow distributing source code for this product
(since it includes quite a bit of some of their sample code).  Those
who are interested in writing their own word processor (similar to RPTEDIT)
should obtain a copy of the Borland RAD pack for Delphi.

The RPTEDIT program is a fairly straight-forward word processor.  Anyone who
has ever used a Windows-based word processor will feel right at home with
RPTEDIT.  By default, RPTEDIT reads and writes files in its own format
(using the ".RPT" filename suffix).  It can also read and write files in the
rich text format (files with the ".RTF" suffix).

In addition to the options available in the menus and on the ruler, RPTEDIT
supports the following mouse and keyboard operations:

Mouse Assignment

Mouse Action		Reaction of Text-Control

Click			Moves cursor to point of click or selects an image.

Shift+Click		Extends the selection to the point of click.

Double-click		Selects the word that is clicked on or opens a modal 
			dialog box to select an image alignment.

Drag			Selects text from point of button down to point where 
			button is released.

Double-click and drag	Extends the selection from word to word.

Triple-click and drag	Extends the selection from row to row.

PgUp/PgDown		Scrolls the text up or down one client area height 
			minus the height of one line of text. Active only

Moving the caret while SHIFT is pressed extends the current selection to
