Note:

To properly execute the SIMx86 program you will need to copy the following two files
to your C:\Windows\System directory (or whereever your windows\system directory
happens to be):

switch.vbx
bivbx11.dll

Without these files in the windows\system directory, the SIMx86.EXE program will
not run.

Note: You may have already copied this files in order to run the LOGIC.EXE program
from chapter two.
