LESSON8 - EXTERNALS AND PUBLICS

now in order to call a proc from another file, the files
which contains the proc will have to declare the proc
as public :

.
.
.

public clearscreen

clearscreen proc far
.
.
.
ret
endp

and in your file you will have to declare the proc as extrn :

.
.
.
extrn clearscreen:far
.
.
call clearscreen

you can also declare public/extrn global arguments.

way of compiling :

your file -  prog.asm
extrn file - clear.asm

than

tasm prog
tasm clear

tlink prog clear

error can occure in tasm if you didn't define public/extrn and in tlink
if you wont supply the extrns.

in this point you know most of assembly but you are lacking of technics
in this point you will have to get sources and analize them, in the
next chapter we will talk about entering info into EXE
