Dr. encryption [CTF] guides to assembly :

before you even start to read, you will have to know :

- pascal or c (very needed)
- memory structure (assembly basic)
- memory sizes (must)
- a clue about computers.

well I wrote it cause.... I was bored actually, if you may have noticed there

happy programming and may lucifer be with you
