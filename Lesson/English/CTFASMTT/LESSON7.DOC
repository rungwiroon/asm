LESSON7 - PROCEDURES AND MACROS

in assembly as in pascal,c and basic you have the option of using
procedures, to declare a procedure you do :

Proc name "proc" distance (far/near)

.
.
.

ret
endp ; end proc

and to call the proc you type "Call Procname"
the ret must come because you have to return to the exact point
you called the proc from, if you pushed registers and didn't pop them
it might not return to the calling position.

sseg segment
  db 10 dup (?)
ends

cseg segment
assume cs:cseg,ds:cseg,ss:sseg,es:nothing

clearscreen proc near

mov ax,0b800h
mov es,ax       ; clear the screen, point to screen
mov di,0

mov ax,0
mov cx,2000
rep stosw       ; if don't understand go back to learn

ret             ; try to erase this and see what happends

endp

start :

push ds

call clearscreen

pop ds

mov ax,4c00h
int 21h

ends
end start
end

what is macro, macro is a type of semi procedure, the compiler
will copy the code of the macro into the calling point
and therefore increasing the code size and saving a few cycles.
one problem the macro has is that you can't use labels becase if
you will and call it number of times there will be duplicate labels
and the compiler will return error message.

macro declarating :
Macro name "macro" parameters
.
.
.
endm ; end macro

to call the macro you just write his name, the parameters
is values to pass

sseg segment
  db 10 dup (?)
ends

cseg segment
assume cs:cseg,ds:cseg,ss:sseg,es:nothing

macro clearscreen amount ; amount is a parameter

mov ax,0b800h
mov es,ax       ; clear the screen, point to screen
mov di,0

mov ax,0
mov cx,amount
rep stosw       ; if don't understand go back to learn

endm            ; go back

start :

push ds

clearscreen 2000 ; the code will be copied to this point

pop ds

mov ax,4c00h
int 21h

ends
end start
end

so when you write code you will have to deside what's better for you speed
(not much) or size (it can go up to ....) I usually use procs

a problem comes up, what happend if a want to use procs and save them
in another file (like unit,lib) and use them in my code, the next
chapter will disscuss that.
