LESSON9 - INCLUDING INFO IN THE EXE

the method to this is almost the same as extrn/public, the way
to this is using the prog "binobj" which comes with tp/bp or bc/tc
and use is a following :
"binobj" <InputFileName> <OutputFileName> <PublicName>
lets say we have pic.dat and we want the public to be dat1 then :
"binobj pic.dat pic.obj dat1" and <-
lets say it was a data of screen made with pascal :

program example ;
  uses dos,crt ;
  var
    z:file ;
begin
  assign (z,'pic.dat') ;
  rewrite (z,1) ;
  blockwrite (z,mem[$b800:0],4000) ;
  close (z) ;
end.

this will give us a screen file, and now how to show it :

sseg segment
  db 10 dup (?)
ends

cseg segment
assume cs:cseg,ss:sseg,ds:cseg,es:nothing

extrn dat1:far

start :

push ds        ; we must save it

mov ax,seg dat1 ; points to extrn seg
mov ds,ax
mov si,offset dat1

mov ax,0b800h  ; adress of screen
mov es,ax
mov di,0

mov cx,2000    ; to speed up use movsw (4000 bytes/2)
rep movsw

pop ds

mov ax,4c00h
int 21h
ends
end start
end

this will write the pic to the screen, compiling goes like that :

"binobj ...."
"tasm filename.asm"
"tlink filename pic.obj"

and that's it, but what if we use a picture, then ???
well you will have to open a new segment for the extrn :
newseg segment
  extrn dat1
ends

this way you will avoid passing the 64k, if your data passes 64k then
split it or use protected mode (how, learn it, it ain't easy) ;

writing a picture to screen (graphic)

program example ;
  uses dos,crt ;
  var
    z:file ;
begin
  assign (z,'pic.dat') ;
  rewrite (z,1) ;
  blockwrite (z,mem[$a000:0],64000) ;
  close (z) ;
end.

sseg segment
  db 10 dup (?)
ends

cseg segment
assume cs:cseg,ss:sseg,ds:cseg,es:nothing

extrn dat1:far

start :

push ds        ; we must save it

mov ax,13h
int 10h         ; goes to graphic mode 320*200*256

mov ax,seg dat1 ; points to extrn seg
mov ds,ax
mov si,offset dat1

mov ax,0a000h  ; adress of screen
mov es,ax
mov di,0

mov cx,32000    ; and,,.... it's on the screen
rep movsw

mov ax,0
int 16h         ; pause

mov ax,3
int 10h         ; goes back to text
pop ds

mov ax,4c00h
int 21h
ends
end start
end

compiling :

"binobj pic.dat pic.obj dat1"
"tasm filename"
"tlink filename pic"

and run, this program doesn't have pal, if you want to add, then go figure
it out (I can't teach you every thing)
