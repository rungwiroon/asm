LESSON 2 - BASIC OPERATORS

after we learned how a basic assembly program is built, we will
learn some basic operators.

MOV destination,source : lets say "mov ax,bx" ax will become the value
                         which bx stores.
ADD destination,count  : lets say "add ax,bx" ax will be increased
                         according to the value in bx - lets say
                         ax = 10, bx = 2 then ax will become 12 (10+2)
SUB destination,count  : lets say "add ax,bx" ax will be decreased
                         according to the value in bx - lets say
                         ax = 10, bx = 2 then ax will become 8 (10-2)
INC destination        : lets say "inc ax" then ax will be ax+1
DEC destination        : lets say "dec ax" then ax will be ax-1
AND destination,count  : lets say "and ax,bx" then ax will be anded
                         with bx, lets say ax = 1, bx = 0 then ax will
                         be 0.
OR  destination,count  : lets say "or ax,bx" then ax will be ored
                         with bx, lets say ax = 1, bx = 0 then ax will
                         be 1.

know after we learnt the basic command, what happend about the size of
those registers well, you can't do one of those between registers
which aren't not the same size : "mov ax,bl", "mov al,bx", "add cx,cl"
and so on.

simple example, if we want to preform subtraction, what will do,
(before each example check if you can do it your self) :
mov ax,20        ; ax will be 20
mov cx,10        ; cx will be 10
sub ax,cx        ; ax will be 10 (ax-cx,20-10)

know if we have a number in hex or bin and we want to put it as it is so
we will have to put "h" after the number for hex and "b" for bin :

mov ax,0a000h  ; you must have a zero before a letter in hex
mov ax,010010b ; a simple number in binary
