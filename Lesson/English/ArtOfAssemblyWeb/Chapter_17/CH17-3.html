<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hardware interrupts are the form most engineers (as opposed
to PC programmers) associate with the term interrupt. We will adopt this same strategy
henceforth and will use the non-modified term &quot;interrupt&quot; to mean a hardware
interrupt. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the PC, interrupts come from many different sources. The
primary sources of interrupts, however, are the PCs timer chip, keyboard, serial ports,
parallel ports, disk drives, CMOS real-time clock, mouse, sound cards, and other
peripheral devices. These devices connect to an Intel 8259A programmable interrupt
controller (PIC) that prioritizes the interrupts and interfaces with the 80x86 CPU. The
8259A chip adds considerable complexity to the software that processes interrupts, so it
makes perfect sense to discuss the PIC first, before trying to describe how the interrupt
service routines have to deal with it. Afterwards, this section will briefly describe each
device and the conditions under which it interrupts the CPU. This text will fully describe
many of these devices in later chapters, so this chapter will not go into a lot of detail
except when discussing the timer interrupt.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING3-4"></a>17.4.1 The 8259A
Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC)</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 8259A (8259<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-6">[6]</a> or PIC,
hereafter) programmable interrupt controller chip accepts interrupts from up to eight
different devices. If any one of the devices requests service, the 8259 will toggle an
interrupt output line (connected to the CPU) and pass a programmable interrupt vector to
the CPU. You can cascade the device to support up to 64 devices by connecting nine 8259s
together: eight of the devices with eight inputs each whose outputs become the eight
inputs of the ninth device. A typical PC uses two of these devices to provide 15 interrupt
inputs (seven on the master PIC with the eight input coming from the slave PIC to process
its eight inputs)<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-7">[7]</a>. The sections following this one will
describe the devices connected to each of those inputs, for now we will concentrate on
what the 8259 does with those inputs. Nevertheless, for the sake of discussion, the
following table lists the interrupt sources on the PC:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 8259 PIC is a very complex chip to program.
Fortunately, all of the hard stuff has already been done for you by the BIOS when the
system boots. We will not discuss how to initialize the 8259 in this text because that
information is only useful to those writing operating systems like Linux, Windows, or
OS/2. If you want your interrupt service routines to run correctly under DOS or any other
OS, you must not reinitialize the PIC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The PICs interface to the system through four I/O
locations: ports 20h/0A0h and 21h/0A1h. The first address in each pair is the address of
the master PIC (IRQ 0-7), the second address in each pair corresponds to the slave PIC
(IRQ 8-15). Port 20h/0A0h is a read/write location to which you write PIC commands and
read PIC status, we will refer to this as the command register or the status register. The
command register is write only, the status register is read only. They just happen to
share the same I/O location. The read/write lines on the PIC determine which register the
CPU accesses. Port 21h/0A1h is a read/write location that contains the interrupt mask
register, we will refer to this as the mask register. Choose the appropriate address
depending upon which interrupt controller you want to use.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The interrupt mask register is an eight bit register that
lets you individually enable and disable interrupts from devices on the system. This is
similar to the actions of the <code>cli </code>and <code>sti </code>instructions, but on a
device by device basis. Writing a zero to the corresponding bit enables that device's
interrupts. Writing a one disables interrupts from the affected device. Note that this is
non-intuitive. The figure below provides the layout of the interrupt mask register.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch17a.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH17/ch17a.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" border="0" WIDTH="290" HEIGHT="210"> </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When changing bits in the mask register, it is important
that you not simply load <code>al</code> with a value and output it directly to the mask
register port. Instead, you should read the mask register and then logically <code>or </code>in
or <code>and </code>out the bits you want to change; finally, you can write the output
back to the mask register. The following code sequence enables COM1: interrupts without
affecting any others:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                in      al, 21h         ;Read existing bits.
                and     al, 0efh        ;Turn on IRQ 4 (COM1).
                out     21h, al         ;Write result back to PIC.</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The command register provides lots of options, but there
are only three commands you would want to execute on this chip that are compatible with
the BIOS' initialization of the 8259: sending an end of interrupt command and sending one
of two read status register commands.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">One a specific interrupt occurs, the 8259 masks all further
interrupts from that device until is receives an end of interrupt signal from the
interrupt service routine. On PCs running DOS, you accomplish this by writing the value
20h to the command register. The following code does this:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                mov     al, 20h
                out     20h, al         ;Port 0A0h if IRQ 8-15.</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You must send exactly one end of interrupt command to the
PIC for each interrupt you service. If you do not send the end of interrupt command, the
PIC will not honor any more interrupts from that device; if you send two or more end of
interrupt commands, there is the possibility that you will accidentally acknowledge a new
interrupt that may be pending and you will lose that interrupt.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For some interrupt service routines you write, your ISR
will not be the only ISR that an interrupt invokes. For example, the PC's BIOS provides an
ISR for the timer interrupt that maintains the time of day. If you patch into the timer
interrupt, you will need to call the PC BIOS' timer ISR so the system can properly
maintain the time of day and handle other timing related chores (see &quot;Chaining
Interrupt Service Routines&quot;). However, the BIOS' timer ISR outputs the end of
interrupt command. Therefore, you should not output the end of interrupt command yourself,
otherwise the BIOS will output a second end of interrupt command and you may lose an
interrupt in the process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The other two commands you can send the 8259 let you select
whether to read the in-service register (ISR) or the interrupt request register (IRR). The
in-service register contains set bits for each active ISR (because the 8259 allows
prioritized interrupts, it is quite possible that one ISR has been interrupted by a higher
priority ISR). The interrupt request register contains set bits in corresponding positions
for interrupts that have not yet been serviced (probably because they are a lower priority
interrupt than the interrupt currently being serviced by the system). To read the
in-service register, you would execute the following statements:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">; Read the in-service register in PIC #1 (at I/O address 20h)

                mov     al, 0bh
                out     20h, al
                in      al, 20h</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To read the interrupt request register, you would use the
following code:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">; Read the interrupt request register in PIC #1 (at I/O address 20h)

                mov     al, 0ah
                out     20h, al
                in      al, 20h</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Writing any other values to the command port may cause your
system to malfunction. </font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING3-39"></a>17.4.2 The Timer
Interrupt (INT 8)</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The PC's motherboard contains an 8254 compatible timer
chip. This chip contains three timer channels, one of which generates interrupts every 55
msec (approximately). This is about once every 1/18.2 seconds. You will often hear this
interrupt referred to as the &quot;eighteenth second clock.&quot; We will simply call it
the timer interrupt.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The timer interrupt vector is probably the most commonly
patched interrupt in the system. It turns out there are two timer interrupt vectors in the
system. Int 8 is the hardware vector associated with the timer interrupt (since it comes
in on IRQ 0 on the PIC). Generally, you should not patch this interrupt if you want to
write a timer ISR. Instead, you should patch the second timer interrupt, interrupt 1ch.
The BIOS' timer interrupt handler (int 8) executes an <code>int 1ch</code> instruction
before it returns. This gives a user patched routine access to the timer interrupt. Unless
you are willing to duplicate the BIOS and DOS timer code, you should never completely
replace the existing timer ISR with one of your own, you should always ensure that the
BIOS and DOS ISRs execute in addition to your ISR. Patching into the int 1ch vector is the
easiest way to do this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even replacing the int 1ch vector with a pointer to your
ISR is very dangerous. The timer interrupt service routine is the one most commonly
patched by various resident programs. By simply writing the address of your ISR into the
timer interrupt vector, you may disable such resident programs and cause your system to
malfunction. To solve this problem, you need to create an interrupt chain. For more
details, see the section &quot;Chaining Interrupt Service Routines&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By default the timer interrupt is always enabled on the
interrupt controller chip. Indeed, disabling this interrupt may cause your system to crash
or otherwise malfunction. At the very least, you system will not maintain the correct time
if you disable the timer interrupt.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING3-44"></a>17.4.3 The Keyboard
Interrupt (INT 9)</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The keyboard microcontroller on the PC's motherboard
generates two interrupts on each keystroke - one when you press a key and one when you
release it. This is on IRQ 1 on the master PIC. The BIOS responds to this interrupt by
reading the keyboard's scan code, converting this to an ASCII character, and storing the
scan and ASCII codes away in the system type ahead buffer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By default, this interrupt is always enabled. If you
disable this interrupt, the system will not be able to respond to any keystrokes,
including ctrl-alt-del. Therefore, your programs should always reenable this interrupt if
they ever disable it.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING3-47"></a>17.4.4 The Serial Port
Interrupts (INT 0Bh and INT 0Ch)</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The PC uses two interrupts, IRQ 3 and IRQ 4, to support
interrupt driven serial communications. The 8250 (or compatible) serial communications
controller chip (SCC) generates an interrupt in one of four situations: a character
arriving over the serial line, the SCC finishes the transmission of a character and is
requesting another, an error occurs, or a status change occurs. The SCC activates the same
interrupt line (IRQ 3 or 4) for all four interrupt sources. The interrupt service routine
is responsible for determining the exact nature of the interrupt by interrogating the SCC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By default, the system disables IRQ 3 and IRQ 4. If you
install a serial ISR, you will need to clear the interrupt mask bit in the 8259 PIC before
it will respond to interrupts from the SCC. Furthermore, the SCC design includes its own
interrupt mask. You will need to enable the interrupt masks on the SCC chip as well. For
more information on the SCC, see the appropriate chapter.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING3-50"></a>17.4.5 The Parallel Port
Interrupts (INT 0Dh and INT 0Fh)</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The parallel port interrupts are an enigma. IBM designed
the original system to allow two parallel port interrupts and then promptly designed a
printer interface card that didn't support the use of interrupts. As a result, almost no
DOS based software today uses the parallel port interrupts (IRQ 5 and IRQ 7). Indeed, on
the PS/2 systems IBM reserved IRQ5 which they formerly used for LPT2:.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, these interrupts have not gone to waste. Many
devices which IBM's engineers couldn't even conceive when designing the first PC have made
good use of these interrupts. Examples include SCSI cards and sound cards. Many devices
today include &quot;interrupt jumpers&quot; that let you select IRQ 5 or IRQ 7 when
installing the device.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since IRQ 5 and IRQ 7 find such little use as parallel port
interrupts, we will effectively ignore the &quot;parallel port interrupts&quot; in this
text.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong><a NAME="HEADING3-54"></a>17.4.6 The Diskette and
Hard Drive Interrupts (INT 0Eh and INT 76h)</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The floppy and hard disk drives generate interrupts at the
completion of a disk operation. This is a very useful feature for multitasking systems
like OS/2, Linux, or Windows. While the disk is reading or writing data, the CPU can go
execute instructions for another process. When the disk finishes the read or write
operation, it interrupts the CPU so it can resume the original task.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">While managing the disk drives would be an interesting
topic to cover in this text, this book is already long enough. Therefore, this text will
avoid discussing the disk drive interrupts (IRQ 6 and IRQ 14) in the interest of saving
some space. There are many texts that cover low level disk I/O in assembly language, see
the bibliography for details.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By default, the floppy and hard disk interrupts are always
enabled. You should not change this status if you intend to use the disk drives on your
system.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong><a NAME="HEADING3-58"></a>17.4.7 The Real-Time
Clock Interrupt (INT 70h)</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PC/AT and later machines included a CMOS real-time clock.
This device is capable of generating timer interrupts in multiples of 976 <em>m</em>sec
(let's call it 1 msec). By default, the real-time clock interrupt is disabled. You should
only enable this interrupt if you have an int 70h ISR installed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong><a NAME="HEADING3-60"></a>17.4.8 The FPU Interrupt
(INT 75h)</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 80x87 FPU generates an interrupt whenever a floating
point exception occurs. On CPUs with built-in FPUs (80486DX and better) there is a bit in
one of the control register you can set to simulate a vectored interrupt. BIOS generally
initializes such bits for compatibility with existing systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By default, BIOS disables the FPU interrupt. Most programs
that use the FPU explicitly test the FPU's status register to determine if an error
occurs. If you want to allow FPU interrupts, you must enable the interrupts on the 8259
and on the 80x87 FPU.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><strong><a NAME="HEADING3-63"></a>17.4.9 Nonmaskable
Interrupts (INT 2)</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 80x86 chips actually provide two interrupt input pins.
The first is the maskable interrupt. This is the pin to which the 8259 PIC connects. This
interrupt is maskable because you can enable or disable it with the <code>cli</code> and <code>sti</code>
instructions. The nonmaskable interrupt, as its name implies, cannot be disabled under
software control. Generally, PCs use this interrupt to signal a memory parity error,
although certain systems use this interrupt for other purposes as well. Many older PC
systems connect the FPU to this interrupt.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As mentioned in the section on the 8259 PIC, there are
several interrupts reserved by IBM. Many systems use the reserved interrupts for the mouse
or for other purposes. Since such interrupts are inherently system dependent, we will not
describe them here.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a NAME="FOOTNOTE-6"></a><strong>[6]</strong> The original
8259 was designed for Intel's 8080 system. The 8259A provided support for the 80x86 and
some other features. Since almost no one uses 8259 chips anymore, this text will use the
generic term 8259. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a NAME="FOOTNOTE-7"></a><strong>[7]</strong> The original
IBM PC and PC/XT machines only supported eight interrupts via one 8259 chip. IBM, and
virtually all clone manufacturers, added the second PIC in PC/AT and later designs.</font></p>
