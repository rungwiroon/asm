<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The concept of an interrupt is something that has expanded
in scope over the years. The 80x86 family has only added to the confusion surrounding
interrupts by introducing the <code>int</code> (software interrupt) instruction. Indeed,
different manufacturers have used terms like exceptions, faults, aborts, traps, and
interrupts to describe the phenomena this chapter discusses. Unfortunately, there is no
clear consensus as to the exact meaning of these terms. Different authors adopt different
terms to their own use. While it is tempting to avoid the use of such misused terms
altogether, for the purpose of discussion it would be nice to have a set of well defined
terms we can use in this chapter. Therefore, we will pick three of the terms above,
interrupts, traps, and exceptions, and define them. This chapter attempts to use the most
common meanings for these terms, but don't be surprised to find other texts using them in
different contexts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On the 80x86, there are three types of events commonly
known as interrupts: traps, exceptions, and interrupts (hardware interrupts). This chapter
will describe each of these forms and discuss their support on the 80x86 CPUs and PC
compatible machines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although the terms trap and exception are often used
synonymously, we will use the term trap to denote a programmer initiated and expected
transfer of control to a special handler routine. In many respects, a trap is nothing more
than a specialized subroutine call. Many texts refer to traps as software interrupts. The
80x86 <code>int</code> instruction is the main vehicle for executing a trap. Note that
traps are usually unconditional; that is, when you execute an <code>int</code>
instruction, control always transfers to the procedure associated with the trap. Since
traps execute via an explicit instruction, it is easy to determine exactly which
instructions in a program will invoke a trap handling routine.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">An exception is an automatically generated trap (coerced
rather than requested) that occurs in response to some exceptional condition. Generally,
there isn't a specific instruction associated with an exception<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a>,
instead, an exception occurs in response to some degenerate behavior of normal 80x86
program execution. Examples of conditions that may raise (cause) an exception include
executing a division instruction with a zero divisor, executing an illegal opcode, and a
memory protection fault. Whenever such a condition occurs, the CPU immediately suspends
execution of the current instruction and transfers control to an exception handler
routine. This routine can decide how to handle the exceptional condition; it can attempt
to rectify the problem or abort the program and print an appropriate error message.
Although you do not generally execute a specific instruction to cause an exception, as
with the software interrupts (traps), execution of some instruction is what causes an
exception. For example, you only get a division error when executing a division
instruction somewhere in a program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hardware interrupts, the third category that we will refer
to simply as interrupts, are program control interruption based on an external hardware
event (external to the CPU). These interrupts generally have nothing at all to do with the
instructions currently executing; instead, some event, such as pressing a key on the
keyboard or a time out on a timer chip, informs the CPU that a device needs some
attention. The CPU interrupts the currently executing program, services the device, and
then returns control back to the program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">An interrupt service routine is a procedure written
specifically to handle a trap, exception, or interrupt. Although different phenomenon
cause traps, exceptions, and interrupts, the structure of an interrupt service routine, or
ISR, is approximately the same for each of these.</font></p>

</center></div>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Despite the different causes of traps, exceptions, and
interrupts, they share a common format for their handling routines. Of course, these
interrupt service routines will perform different activities depending on the source of
the invocation, but it is quite possible to write a single interrupt handling routine that
processes traps, exceptions, and hardware interrupts. This is rarely done, but the
structure of the 80x86 interrupt system allows this. This section will describe the
80x86's interrupt structure and how to write basic interrupt service routines for the
80x86 real mode interrupts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 80x86 chips allow up to 256 vectored interrupts. This
means that you can have up to 256 different sources for an interrupt and the 80x86 will
directly call the service routine for that interrupt without any software processing. This
is in contrast to nonvectored interrupts that transfer control directly to a single
interrupt service routine, regardless of the interrupt source.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 80x86 provides a 256 entry interrupt vector table
beginning at address 0:0 in memory. This is a 1K table containing 256 4-byte entries. Each
entry in this table contains a segmented address that points at the interrupt service
routine in memory. Generally, we will refer to interrupts by their index into this table,
so interrupt zero's address (vector) is at memory location 0:0, interrupt one's vector is
at address 0:4, interrupt two's vector is at address 0:8, etc.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When an interrupt occurs, regardless of source, the 80x86
does the following:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) The CPU pushes the flags register onto the stack.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">2) The CPU pushes a far return address (segment:offset)
onto the stack, segment value first.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">3) The CPU determines the cause of the interrupt (i.e., the
interrupt number) and fetches the four byte interrupt vector from address 0:vector*4.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">4) The CPU transfers control to the routine specified by
the interrupt vector table entry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After the completion of these steps, the interrupt service
routine takes control. When the interrupt service routine wants to return control, it must
execute an <code>iret</code> (interrupt return) instruction. The interrupt return pops the
far return address and the flags off the stack. Note that executing a far return is
insufficient since that would leave the flags on the stack.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is one minor difference between how the 80x86
processes hardware interrupts and other types of interrupts - upon entry into the hardware
interrupt service routine, the 80x86 disables further hardware interrupts by clearing the
interrupt flag. Traps and exceptions do not do this. If you want to disallow further
hardware interrupts within a trap or exception handler, you must explicitly clear the
interrupt flag with a <code>cli</code> instruction. Conversely, if you want to allow
interrupts within a hardware interrupt service routine, you must explicitly turn them back
on with an <code>sti</code> instruction. Note that the 80x86's interrupt disable flag only
affects hardware interrupts. Clearing the interrupt flag will not prevent the execution of
a trap or exception.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ISRs are written like almost any other assembly language
procedure except that they return with an <code>iret</code> instruction rather than <code>ret</code>.
Although the distance of the ISR procedure (near vs. far) is usually of no significance,
you should make all ISRs far procedures. This will make programming easier if you decide
to call an ISR directly rather than using the normal interrupt handling mechanism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Exceptions and hardware interrupts ISRs have a very special
restriction: they must preserve the state of the CPU. In particular, these ISRs must
preserve all registers they modify. Consider the following extremely simple ISR: </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">SimpleISR       proc    far
                mov     ax, 0
                iret
SimpleISR       endp</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This ISR obviously does not preserve the machine state; it
explicitly disturbs the value in ax and then returns from the interrupt. Suppose you were
executing the following code segment when a hardware interrupt transferred control to the
above ISR: </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                mov     ax, 5
                add     ax, 2</font></pre>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">; Suppose the interrupt occurs here.</font></pre>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                puti
                 .
                 .
                 .</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The interrupt service routine would set the <code>ax</code>
register to zero and your program would print zero rather than the value five. Worse yet,
hardware interrupts are generally asynchronous, meaning they can occur at any time and
rarely do they occur at the same spot in a program. Therefore, the code sequence above
would print seven most of the time; once in a great while it might print zero or two (it
will print two if the interrupt occurs between the <code>mov ax, 5 </code>and <code>add
ax, 2</code> instructions). Bugs in hardware interrupt service routines are very difficult
to find, because such bugs often affect the execution of unrelated code.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The solution to this problem, of course, is to make sure
you preserve all registers you use in the interrupt service routine for hardware
interrupts and exceptions. Since trap calls are explicit, the rules for preserving the
state of the machine in such programs is identical to that for procedures.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Writing an ISR is only the first step to implementing an
interrupt handler. You must also initialize the interrupt vector table entry with the
address of your ISR. There are two common ways to accomplish this - store the address
directly in the interrupt vector table or call DOS and let DOS do the job for you.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Storing the address yourself is an easy task. All you need
to do is load a segment register with zero (since the interrupt vector table is in segment
zero) and store the four byte address at the appropriate offset within that segment. The
following code sequence initializes the entry for interrupt 255 with the address of the
SimpleISR routine presented earlier: </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                mov     ax, 0
                mov     es, ax
                pushf
                cli
                mov     word ptr es:[0ffh*4], offset SimpleISR
                mov     word ptr es:[0ffh*4 + 2], seg SimpleISR
                popf</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note how this code turns off the interrupts while changing
the interrupt vector table. This is important if you are patching a hardware interrupt
vector because it wouldn't do for the interrupt to occur between the last two <code>mov</code>
instructions above; at that point the interrupt vector is in an inconsistent state and
invoking the interrupt at that point would transfer control to the offset of SimpleISR and
the segment of the previous interrupt 0FFh handler. This, of course, would be a disaster.
The instructions that turn off the interrupts while patching the vector are unnecessary if
you are patching in the address of a trap or exception handler<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Perhaps a better way to initialize an interrupt vector is
to use DOS' Set Interrupt Vector call. Calling DOS with <code>ah</code> equal to 25h
provides this function. This call expects an interrupt number in the <code>al</code>
register and the address of the interrupt service routine in <code>ds:dx</code>. The call
to MS-DOS that would accomplish the same thing as the code above is </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                mov     ax, 25ffh               ;AH=25h, AL=0FFh.
                mov     dx, seg SimpleISR       ;Load DS:DX with
                mov     ds, dx                  ; address of ISR
                lea     dx, SimpleISR
                int     21h                     ;Call DOS
                mov     ax, dseg                ;Restore DS so it
                mov     ds, ax                  ; points back at DSEG.</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although this code sequence is a little more complex than
poking the data directly into the interrupt vector table, it is safer. Many programs
monitor changes made to the interrupt vector table through DOS. If you call DOS to change
an interrupt vector table entry, those programs will become aware of your changes. If you
circumvent DOS, those programs may not find out that you've patched in your own interrupt
and could malfunction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Generally, it is a very bad idea to patch the interrupt
vector table and not restore the original entry after your program terminates. Well
behaved programs always save the previous value of an interrupt vector table entry and
restore this value before termination. The following code sequences demonstrate how to do
this. First, by patching the table directly: </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                mov     ax, 0
                mov     es, ax

; Save the current entry in the dword variable IntVectSave:

                mov     ax, es:[IntNumber*4]
                mov     word ptr IntVectSave, ax
                mov     ax, es:[IntNumber*4 + 2]
                mov     word ptr IntVectSave+2, ax

; Patch the interrupt vector table with the address of our ISR

                pushf                   ;Required if this is a hw interrupt.
                cli                     ; &quot;        &quot;   &quot;   &quot; &quot;  &quot;     &quot;

                mov     word ptr es:[IntNumber*4+2], seg OurISR

                popf                    ;Required if this is a hw interrupt.

                 .
                 .

; Restore the interrupt vector entries before quitting:

                mov     ax, 0

                cli                     ;   &quot;      &quot;  &quot;    &quot;   &quot;     &quot;

                mov     es:[IntNumber*4], ax
                mov     ax, word ptr IntVectSave+2
                mov     es:[IntNumber*4 + 2], ax

                popf                    ;Required if this is a hw interrupt.
                 .
                 .
                 .</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you would prefer to call DOS to save and restore the
interrupt vector table entries, you can obtain the address of an existing interrupt table
entry using the DOS Get Interrupt Vector call. This call, with ah=35h, expects the
interrupt number in al; it returns the existing vector for that interrupt in the es:bx
registers. Sample code that preserves the interrupt vector using DOS is </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">; Save the current entry in the dword variable IntVectSave:

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A trap is a software-invoked interrupt. To execute a trap,
you use the 80x86 <code>int</code> (software interrupt) instruction<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a>.
There are only two primary differences between a trap and an arbitrary far procedure call:
the instruction you use to call the routine (<code>int</code> vs. <code>call</code>) and
the fact that a trap pushes the flags on the stack so you must use the <code>iret</code>
instruction to return from it. Otherwise, there really is no difference between a trap
handler's code and the body of a typical far procedure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The main purpose of a trap is to provide a fixed subroutine
that various programs can call without having to actually know the run-time address.
MS-DOS is the perfect example. The <code>int 21h</code> instruction is an example of a
trap invocation. Your programs do not have to know the actual memory address of DOS' entry
point to call DOS. Instead, DOS patches the interrupt 21h vector when it loads into
memory. When you execute <code>int 21h</code>, the 80x86 automatically transfers control
to DOS' entry point, whereever in memory that happens to be.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is a long lists of support routines that use the trap
mechanism to link application programs to themselves. DOS, BIOS, the mouse drivers, and
Netware<em>'</em> are a few examples. Generally, you would use a trap to call a resident
program function. Resident programs load themselves into memory and remain resident once
they terminate. By patching an interrupt vector to point at a subroutine within the
resident code, other programs that run after the resident program terminates can call the
resident subroutines by executing the appropriate <code>int</code> instruction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most resident programs do not use a separate interrupt
vector entry for each function they provide. Instead, they usually patch a single
interrupt vector and transfer control to an appropriate routine using a function number
that the caller passes in a register. By convention, most resident programs expect the
function number in the <code>ah</code> register. A typical trap handler would execute a
case statement on the value in the ah register and transfer control to the appropriate
handler function. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since trap handlers are virtually identical to far
procedures in terms of use, we will not discuss traps in any more detail here. However,
the text chapter will explore this subject in greater depth when it discusses resident
programs.</font></p>

<hr noshade size="1" color="#000000">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a NAME="FOOTNOTE-1"></a><strong>[1]</strong> Although we
will classify the <code>into</code> instruction in this category. This is an exception to
this rule. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a NAME="FOOTNOTE-2"></a><strong>[2]</strong> Strictly
speaking, this code sequence does not require the pushf, cli, and popf instructions
because interrupt 255 does not correspond to any hardware interrupt on a typical PC
machine. However, it is important to provide this example so you're aware of the problem. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a NAME="FOOTNOTE-3"></a><strong>[3]</strong> You can also
simulate an int instruction by pushing the flags and executing a far call to the trap
handler. We will consider this mechanism later on.</font></p>
