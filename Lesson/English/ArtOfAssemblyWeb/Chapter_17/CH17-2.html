<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Exceptions occur (are raised) when an abnormal condition
occurs during execution. There are fewer than eight possible exceptions on machines
running in real mode. Protected mode execution provides many others, but we will not
consider those here, we will only consider those exceptions interesting to those working
in real mode<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-4">[4]</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although exception handlers are user defined, the 80x86
hardware defines the exceptions that can occur. The 80x86 also assigns a fixed interrupt
number to each of the exceptions. The following sections describe each of these exceptions
in detail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In general, an exception handler should preserve all
registers. However, there are several special cases where you may want to tweak a register
value before returning. For example, if you get a bounds violation, you may want to modify
the value in the register specified by the <code>bound</code> instruction before
returning. Nevertheless, you should not arbitrarily modify registers in an exception
handling routine unless you intend to immediately abort the execution of your program.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING2-5"></a>17.3.1 Divide Error
Exception (INT 0)</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This exception occurs whenever you attempt to divide a
value by zero or the quotient does not fit in the destination register when using the <code>div</code>
or <code>idiv</code> instructions. Note that the FPU's fdiv and fdivr instructions do not
raise this exception.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">MS-DOS provides a generic divide exception handler that
prints a message like &quot;divide error&quot; and returns control to MS-DOS. If you want
to handle division errors yourself, you must write your own exception handler and patch
the address of this routine into location 0:0.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On 8086, 8088, 80186, and 80188 processors, the return
address on the stack points at the next instruction after the divide instruction. On the
80286 and later processors, the return address points at the beginning of the divide
instruction (include any prefix bytes that appear). When a divide exception occurs, the
80x86 registers are unmodified; that is, they contain the values they held when the 80x86
first executed the <code>div</code> or <code>idiv</code> instruction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When a divide exception occurs, there are three reasonable
things you can attempt: abort the program (the easy way out), jump to a section of code
that attempts to continue program execution in view of the error (e.g., as the user to
reenter a value), or attempt to figure out why the error occurred, correct it, and
reexecute the division instruction. Few people choose this last alternative because it is
so difficult.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING2-10"></a>17.3.2 Single Step
(Trace) Exception (INT 1)</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The single step exception occurs after every instruction if
the trace bit in the flags register is equal to one. Debuggers and other programs will
often set this flag so they can trace the execution of a program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When this exception occurs, the return address on the stack
is the address of the next instruction to execute. The trap handler can decode this opcode
and decide how to proceed. Most debuggers use the trace exception to check for watchpoints
and other events that change dynamically during program execution. Debuggers that use the
trace exception for single stepping often disassemble the next instruction using the
return address on the stack as a pointer to that instruction's opcode bytes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Generally, a single step exception handler should preserve
all 80x86 registers and other state information. However, you will see an interesting use
of the trace exception later in this text where we will purposely modify register values
to make one instruction behave like another.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Interrupt one is also shared by the debugging exceptions
capabilities of 80386 and later processors. These processors provide on-chip support via
debugging registers. If some condition occurs that matches a value in one of the debugging
registers, the 80386 and later CPUs will generate a debugging exception that uses
interrupt vector one.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING2-15"></a>17.3.3 Breakpoint
Exception (INT 3)</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The breakpoint exception is actually a trap, not an
exception. It occurs when the CPU executes an <code>int 3</code> instruction. However, we
will consider it an exception since programmers rarely put <code>int 3</code> instructions
directly into their programs. Instead, a debugger like Codeview often manages the
placement and removal of <code>int 3 </code>instructions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the 80x86 calls a breakpoint exception handling
routine, the return address on the stack is the address of the next instruction after the
breakpoint opcode. Note, however, that there are actually two <code>int</code>
instructions that transfer control through this vector. Generally, though, it is the
one-byte <code>int 3</code> instruction whose opcode is 0cch; otherwise it is the two byte
equivalent: 0cdh, 03h.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING2-18"></a>17.3.4 Overflow Exception
(INT 4/INTO)</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The overflow exception, like <code>int 3</code>, is
technically a trap. The CPU only raises this exception when you execute an <code>into</code>
instruction and the overflow flag is set. If the overflow flag is clear, the <code>into</code>
instruction is effectively a <code>nop</code>, if the overflow flag is set,<code> into </code>behaves
like an </font><code><font face="Courier New" size="2">int 4</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> </code>instruction<code>. </code>Programmers can insert an <code>into</code>
instruction after an integer computation to check for an arithmetic overflow. Using <code>into</code>
is equivalent to the following code sequence:</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;&lt; Some integer arithmetic code »<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
jno &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GoodCode<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
int &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br>
GoodCode:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">One big advantage to the <code>into</code> instruction is
that it does not flush the pipeline or prefetch queue if the overflow flag is not set.
Therefore, using the <code>into</code> instruction is a good technique if you provide a
single overflow handler (that is, you don't have some special code for each sequence where
an overflow could occur).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The return address on the stack is the address of the next
instruction after <code>into</code>. Generally, an overflow handler does not return to
that address. Instead, it will usually abort the program or pop the return address and
flags off the stack and attempt the computation in a different way.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING2-27"></a>17.3.5 Bounds Exception
(INT 5/BOUND)</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Like <code>into</code>, the <code>bound</code> instruction
will cause a conditional exception. If the specified register is outside the specified
bounds, the <code>bound</code> instruction is equivalent to an <code>int 5</code>
instruction; if the register is within the specified bounds, the <code>bound</code>
instruction is effectively a nop.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The return address that <code>bound</code> pushes is the
address of the <code>bound</code> instruction itself, not the instruction following <code>bound</code>.
If you return from the exception without modifying the value in the register (or adjusting
the bounds), you will generate an infinite loop because the code will reexecute the <code>bound</code>
instruction and repeat this process over and over again.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">One sneaky trick with the <code>bound</code> instruction is
to generate a global minimum and maximum for an array of signed integers. The following
code demonstrates how you can do this: </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">; This program demonstrates how to compute the minimum and maximum values
; for an array of signed integers using the bound instruction

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If the array is large and the values appearing in the array
are relatively random, this code demonstrates a fast way to determine the minimum and
maximum values in the array. The alternative, comparing each element against the upper and
lower bounds and storing the value if outside the range, is generally a slower approach.
True, if the <code>bound</code> instruction causes a trap, this is much slower than the
compare and store method. However, it a large array with random values, the bounds
violation will rarely occur. Most of the time the <code>bound</code> instruction will
execute in 7-13 clock cycles and it will not flush the pipeline or the prefetch queue<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-5">[5]</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Warning: IBM, in their infinite wisdom, decided to use <code>int
5</code> as the print screen operation. The default <code>int 5</code> handler will dump
the current contents of the screen to the printer. This has two implications for those who
would like to use the <code>bound</code> instruction in their programs. First, if you do
not install your own<code> int 5</code> handler and you execute a <code>bound</code>
instruction that generates a bound exception, you will cause the machine to print the
contents of the screen. Second, if you press the PrtSc key with your <code>int 5 </code>handler
installed, BIOS will invoke your handler. The former case is a programming error, but this
latter case means you have to make your bounds exception handler a little smarter. It
should look at the byte pointed at by the return address. If this is an <code>int 5</code>
instruction opcode (0cdh), then you need to call the original <code>int 5</code> handler,
or simply return from interrupt (do you want them pressing the PrtSc key at that point?).
If it is not an <code>int 5</code> opcode, then this exception was probably raised by the <code>bound</code>
instruction. Note that when executing a <code>bound</code> instruction the return address
may not be pointing directly at a <code>bound</code> opcode (0c2h). It may be pointing at
a prefix byte to the <code>bound</code> instruction (e.g., segment, addressing mode, or
size override). Therefore, it is best to check for the <code>int 5</code> opcode.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING2-155"></a>17.3.6 Invalid Opcode
Exception (INT 6)</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 80286 and later processors raise this exception if you
attempt to execute an opcode that does not correspond to a legal 80x86 instruction. These
processors also raise this exception if you attempt to execute a bound, lds, les, lidt, or
other instruction that requires a memory operand but you specify a register operand in the
mod/rm field of the mod/reg/rm byte.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The return address on the stack points at the illegal
opcode. By examining this opcode, you can extend the instruction set of the 80x86. For
example, you could run 80486 code on an 80386 processor by providing subroutines that
mimic the extra 80486 instructions (like <code>bswap</code>, <code>cmpxchg</code>, etc.).</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING2-158"></a>17.3.7 Coprocessor Not
Available (INT 7)</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The 80286 and later processors raise this exception if you
attempt to execute an FPU (or other coprocessor) instruction without having the
coprocessor installed. You can use this exception to simulate the coprocessor in software.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On entry to the exception handler, the return address
points at the coprocessor opcode that generated the exception.</font></p>
