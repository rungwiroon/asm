<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This chapter completes the discussion of procedures,
parameters, and local variables begun in the previous chapter. This chapter describes how
block structured languages like Pascal, Modula-2, Algol, and Ada access local and
non-local variables. This chapter also describes how to implement a user-defined control
structure, the iterator. Most of the material in this chapter is of interest to compiler
writers and those who want to learn how compilers generate code for certain types of
program constructs. Few pure assembly language programs will use the techniques this
chapter describes. Therefore, none of the material in this chapter is particularly
important to those who are just learning assembly language. However, if you are going to
write a compiler, or you want to learn how compilers generate code so you can write
efficient HLL programs, you will want to learn the material in this chapter sooner or
later.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This chapter begins by discussing the notion of scope and
how HLLs like Pascal access variables in nested procedures. The first section discusses
the concept of lexical nesting and the use of static links and displays to access
non-local variables. Next, this chapter discusses how to pass variables at different lex
levels as parameters. The third section discusses how to pass parameters of one procedure
as parameters to another procedure. The fourth major topic this chapter covers is passing
procedures as parameters. This chapter concludes with a discussion of iterators, a
user-defined control structure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This chapter assumes a familiarity with a block structured
language like Pascal or Ada. If your only HLL experience is with a non-block structured
language like C, C++, BASIC, or FORTRAN, some of the concepts in this chapter may be
completely new and you will have trouble understanding them. Any introductory text on
Pascal or Ada will help explain any concept you don't understand that this chapter assumes
is a prerequisite.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In block structured languages like Pascal<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a> it is possible to nest procedures and functions. Nesting one
procedure within another limits the access to the nested procedure; you cannot access the
nested procedure from outside the enclosing procedure. Likewise, variables you declare
within a procedure are visible inside that procedure and to all procedures nested within
that procedure<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-2">[2]</a>. This is the standard block structured
language notion of scope that should be quite familiar to anyone who has written Pascal or
Ada programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is a good deal of complexity hidden behind the
concept of scope, or lexical nesting, in a block structured language. While accessing a
local variable in the current activation record is efficient, accessing global variables
in a block structured language can be very inefficient. This section will describe how a
HLL like Pascal deals with non-local identifiers and how to access global variables and
call non-local procedures and functions.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING1-9"></a>12.1.1 Scope</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Scope in most high level languages is a static, or
compile-time concept<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-3">[3]</a>. Scope is the notion of when a name is
visible, or accessible, within a program. This ability to hide names is useful in a
program because it is often convenient to reuse certain (non-descriptive) names. The<code>
i </code>variable used to control most <code>for</code> loops in high level languages is a
perfect example. Throughout this chapter you've seen equates like <code>xyz_i</code>, <code>xyz_j</code>,
etc. The reason for choosing such names is that MASM doesn't support the same notion of
scoped names as high level languages. Fortunately, MASM 6.x and later does support scoped
names.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By default, MASM 6.x treats statement labels (those with a
colon after them) as local to a procedure. That is, you may only reference such labels
within the procedure in which they are declared. This is true even if you nest one
procedure inside another. Fortunately, there is no good reason why anyone would want to
nest procedures in a MASM program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Having local labels within a procedure is nice. It allows
you to reuse statement labels (e.g., loop labels and such) without worrying about name
conflicts with other procedures. Sometimes, however, you may want to turn off the scoping
of names in a procedure; a good example is when you have a case statement whose jump table
appears outside the procedure. If the case statement labels are local to the procedure,
they will not be visible outside the procedure and you cannot use them in the case
statement jump table. There are two ways you can turn off the scoping of labels in MASM
6.x. The first way is to include the statement in your program:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                 option  noscoped</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This will turn off variable scoping from that point forward
in your program's source file. You can turn scoping back on with a statement of the form</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                option  scoped</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By placing these statements around your procedure you can
selectively control scoping.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another way to control the scoping of individual names is
to place a double colon (&quot;::&quot;) after a label. This informs the assembler that
this particular name should be global to the enclosing procedure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">MASM, like the C programming language, supports three
levels of scope: public, global (or static), and local. Local symbols are visible only
within the procedure they are defined. Global symbols are accessible throughout a source
file, but are not visible in other program modules. Public symbols are visible throughout
a program, across modules. MASM uses the following default scoping rules:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">By default, statement labels appearing in a procedure are
    local to that procedure. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">By default, all procedure names are public. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">By default, most other symbols are global. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note that these rules apply to MASM 6.x only. Other
assemblers and earlier versions of MASM follow different rules.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Overriding the default on the first rule above is easy -
either use the <code>option noscoped </code>statement or use a double colon to make a
label global. You should be aware, though, that you cannot make a local label public using
the <code>public</code> or <code>externdef</code> directives. You must make the symbol
global (using either technique) before you make it public.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Having all procedure names public by default usually isn't
much of a problem. However, it might turn out that you want to use the same (local)
procedure name in several different modules. If MASM automatically makes such names
public, the linker will give you an error because there are multiple public procedures
with the same name. You can turn on and off this default action using the following
statements:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                option  proc:private    ;procedures are global
                option  proc:export     ;procedures are public</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note that some debuggers only provide symbolic information
if a procedure's name is public. This is why MASM 6.x defaults to public names. This
problem does not exist with CodeView; so you can use whichever default is most convenient.
Of course, if you elect to keep procedure names private (global only), then you will need
to use the <code>public</code> or <code>externdef</code> directive to make desired
procedure names public.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This discussion of local, global, and public symbols
applies mainly to statement and procedure labels. It does not apply to variables you've
declared in your data segment, equates, macros, typedefs, or most other symbols. Such
symbols are always global regardless of where you define them. The only way to make them
public is to specify their names in a <code>public</code> or <code>externdef</code>
directive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is a way to declare parameter names and local
variables, allocated on the stack, such that their names are local to a given procedure.
See the <code>proc</code> directive in the MASM reference manual for details.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The scope of a name limits its visibility within a program.
That is, a program has access to a variable name only within that name's scope. Outside
the scope, the program cannot access that name. Many programming languages, like Pascal
and C++, allow you to reuse identifiers if the scopes of those multiple uses do not
overlap. As you've seen, MASM provides some minimal scoping features for statement labels.
There is, however, another issue related to scope: address binding and variable lifetime.
Address binding is the process of associating a memory address with a variable name.
Variable lifetime is that portion of a program's execution during which a memory location
is bound to a variable. Consider the following Pascal procedures:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">procedure One(Entry:integer);
var
        i,j:integer;

        procedure Two(Parm:integer);
        var j:integer;
        begin

                for j:= 0 to 5 do writeln(i+j);
                if Parm &lt; 10 then One(Parm+1);

        end;

begin {One}
        for i := 1 to 5 do Two(Entry);
end;</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The figure below shows the scope of identifiers <code>One</code>,
<code>Two</code>, <code>Entry</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>Parm.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><img SRC="images/ch12a.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH12/ch12a.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="115"></code> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The local variable <code>j</code> in <code>Two</code> masks
the identifier <code>j</code> in procedure <code>One</code> while inside <code>Two</code>.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING1-56"></a>12.1.2 Unit Activation,
Address Binding, and Variable Lifetime </font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unit activation is the process of calling a procedure or
function. The combination of an activation record and some executing code is considered an
instance of a routine. When unit activation occurs a routine binds machine addresses to
its local variables. Address binding (for local variables) occurs when the routine adjusts
the stack pointer to make room for the local variables. The lifetime of those variables is
from that point until the routine destroys the activation record eliminating the local
variable storage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although scope limits the visibility of a name to a certain
section of code and does not allow duplicate names within the same scope, this does not
mean that there is only one address bound to a name. It is quite possible to have several
addresses bound to the same name at the same time. Consider a recursive procedure call. On
each activation the procedure builds a new activation record. Since the previous instance
still exists, there are now two activation records on the stack containing local variables
for that procedure. As additional recursive activations occur, the system builds more
activation records each with an address bound to the same name. To resolve the possible
ambiguity (which address do you access when operating on the variable?), the system always
manipulates the variable in the most recent activation record.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note that procedures <code>One</code> and <code>Two</code>
in the previous section are indirectly recursive. That is, they both call routines which,
in turn, call themselves. Assuming the parameter to <code>One</code> is less than 10 on
the initial call, this code will generate multiple activation records (and, therefore,
multiple copies of the local variables) on the stack. For example, were you to issue the
call <code>One(9)</code>, the stack would look like the figure below upon first

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As you can see, there are several copies of <code>I</code>
and <code>J</code> on the stack at this point. Procedure <code>Two</code> (the currently
executing routine) would access <code>J</code> in the most recent activation record that
is at the bottom of the figure. The previous instance of <code>Two</code> will only access
the variable <code>J</code> in its activation record when the current instance returns to <code>One</code>
and then back to <code>Two</code>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The lifetime of a variable's instance is from the point of
activation record creation to the point of activation record destruction. Note that the
first instance of <code>J</code> above (the one at the top of the diagram above) has the
longest lifetime and that the lifetimes of all instances of<code> J</code> overlap.</font>
