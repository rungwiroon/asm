<p><font face="Arial" size="2">An iterator is a cross between a control structure and a
function. Although common high level languages do not often support iterators, they are
present in some very high level languages<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-11">[11]</a>. Iterators
provide a combination state machine/function call mechanism that lets a function pick up
where it last left off on each new call. Iterators are also part of a loop control
structure, with the iterator providing the value of the loop control variable on each
iteration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To understand what an iterator is, consider the following <code>for</code>
loop from Pascal:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">		for I := 1 to 10 do &lt;some statement&gt;;</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When learning Pascal you were probably taught that this
statement initializes <code>i</code> with one, compares<code> i</code> with 10, and
executes the statement if <code>i</code> is less than or equal to 10. After executing the
statement, the <code>for</code> statement increments <code>i</code> and compares it with
10 again, repeating the process over and over again until I is greater than 10. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">While this description is semantically correct, and indeed,
it's the way that most Pascal compilers implement the <code>for</code> loop, this is not
the only point of view that describes how the <code>for</code> loop operates. Suppose,
instead, that you were to treat the &quot;<code>to</code>&quot; reserved word as an
operator. An operator that expects two parameters (one and ten in this case) and returns
the range of values on each successive execution. That is, on the first call the &quot;<code>to</code>&quot;
operator would return one, on the second call it would return two, etc. After the tenth
call, the &quot;<code>to</code>&quot; operator would fail which would terminate the loop.
This is exactly the description of an iterator.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In general, an iterator controls a loop. Different
languages use different names for iterator controlled loops, this text will just use the
name foreach as follows:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">	foreach variable in iterator() do 
		statements;
	endfor;</font></pre>
<code>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Variable</code> is a variable whose type is compatible with
the return type of the <code>iterator</code>. An iterator returns two values: a boolean
success or failure value and a function result. As long as the iterator returns success,
the <code>foreach</code> statement assigns the other return value to <code>variable</code>
and executes <code>statements</code>. If <code>iterator</code> returns failure, the
foreach loop terminates and executes the next sequential statement following the <code>foreach</code>
loop's body. In the case of failure, the <code>foreach</code> statement does not affect
the value of <code>variable</code>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Iterators are considerably more complex than normal
functions. A typical function call involves two basic operations: a call and a return.
Iterator invocations involve four basic operations:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) Initial iterator call </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">2) Yielding a value </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">3) Resumption of an iterator </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">4) Termination of an iterator. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To understand how an iterator operates, consider the
following short example from the Panacea programming language<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-12">[12]</a>:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">Range:iterator(start,stop:integer):integer;
begin range;

        while (start &lt;= stop) do

                yield start;
                start := start + 1;

        endwhile;

end Range;</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the Panacea programming language, iterator calls may
only appear in the foreach statement. With the exception of the yield statement above,
anyone familiar with Pascal or C++ should be able to figure out the basic logic of this
iterator.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">An iterator in the Panacea programming language may return
to its caller using one of two separate mechanisms, it can return to the caller, by
exiting through the <code>end Range; </code>statement or it may yield a value by executing
the <code>yield</code> statement. An iterator succeeds if it executes the <code>yield</code>
statement, it fails if it simply returns to the caller. Therefore, the <code>foreach</code>
statement will only execute its corresponding statement if you exit an iterator with a <code>yield</code>.
The <code>foreach</code> statement terminates if you simply return from the iterator. In
the example above, the iterator returns the values <code>start..stop</code> via a <code>yield</code>
and then the iterator terminates. The loop</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                foreach i in Range(1,10) do 
                        write(i);
                endfor;</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">is comparable to the Pascal statement:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                for i := 1 to 10 do write(i);</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When a Panacea program first executes the <code>foreach</code>
statement, it makes an initial call to the iterator. The iterator runs until it executes a
<code>yield</code> or it returns. If it executes the <code>yield</code> statement, it
returns the value of the expression following the <code>yield</code> as the iterator
result and it returns success. If it simply returns, the iterator returns failure and no
iterator result. In the current example, the initial call to the iterator returns success
and the value one.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Assuming a successful return (as in the current example),
the <code>foreach</code> statement assigns the iterator return value to the loop control
variable and executes the <code>foreach</code> loop body. After executing the loop body,
the <code>foreach</code> statement calls the iterator again. However, this time the
foreach statement resumes the iterator rather than making an initial call. An iterator
resumption continues with the first statement following the last <code>yield</code> it
executed. In the <code>range</code> example, a resumption would continue execution at the <code>start
:= start + 1; </code>statement. On the first resumption, the <code>Range</code> iterator
would add one to <code>start, </code>producing the value two. Two is less than ten (<code>stop</code>'s
value) so the <code>while</code> loop would repeat and the iterator would yield the value
two. This process would repeat over and over again until the iterator yields ten. Upon
resuming after yielding ten, the iterator would increment start to eleven and then return,
rather than yield, since this new value is not less than or equal to ten. When the <code>range</code>
iterator returns (fails), the <code>foreach</code> loop terminates.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING6-44"></a>12.5.1 Implementing
Iterators Using In-Line Expansion</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The implementation of an iterator is rather complex. To
begin with, consider a first attempt at an assembly implementation of the foreach
statement above:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                push    1               ;Assume 286 or better
                push    10              ; and parms passed on stack.
                call    Range_Initial   ;Make initial call to iter.
                jc      Failure         ;C=0, 1 means success, fail.
ForLoop:        puti                    ;Assume result is in AX.
                call    Range_Resume    ;Resume iterator.
                jnc     ForLoop         ;Carry clear is success!
Failure:</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although this looks like a straight-forward implementation
project, there are several issues to consider. First, the call to <code>Range_Resume</code>
above looks simple enough, but there is no fixed address that corresponds to the resume
address. While it is certainly true that this <code>Range</code> example has only one
resume address, in general you can have as many yield statements as you like in an
iterator. For example, the following iterator returns the values 1, 2, 3, and 4:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">        OneToFour:iterator:integer;
        begin OneToFour;

                yield 1; 
                yield 2; 
                yield 3; 
                yield 4;

        end OneToFour;</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The initial call would execute the<code> yield 1; </code>statement.
The first resumption would execute the<code> yield 2; </code>statement, the second
resumption would execute <code>yield 3</code>;, etc. Obviously there is no single resume
address the calling code can count on.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are a couple of additional details left to consider.
First, an iterator is free to call procedures and functions<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-13">[13]</a>.
If such a procedure or function executes the <code>yield</code> statement then resumption
by the <code>foreach</code> statement continues execution within the procedure or function
that executed the <code>yield</code>. Second, the semantics of an iterator require all
local variables and parameters to maintain their values until the iterator terminates.
That is, yielding does not deallocate local variables and parameters. Likewise, any return
addresses left on the stack (e.g., the call to a procedure or function that executes the <code>yield</code>
statement) must not be lost when a piece of code yields and the corresponding <code>foreach</code>
statement resumes the iterator. In general, this means you cannot use the standard call
and return sequence to yield from or resume to an iterator because you have to preserve
the contents of the stack.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">While there are several ways to implement iterators in
assembly language, perhaps the most practical method is to have the iterator call the loop
controlled by the iterator and have the loop return back to the iterator function. Of
course, this is counter-intuitive. Normally, one thinks of the iterator as the function
that the loop calls on each iteration, not the other way around. However, given the
structure of the stack during the execution of an iterator, the counter-intuitive approach
turns out to be easier to implement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some high level languages support iterators in exactly this
fashion. For example, Metaware's Professional Pascal Compiler for the PC supports
iterators<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-14">[14]</a>. Were you to create a code sequence as follows:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">        iterator OneToFour:integer;
        begin
                yield 1;
                yield 2;
                yield 3;
                yield 4;
        end;</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">and call it in the main program as follows:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">	for i in OneToFour do writeln(i);</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Professional Pascal would completely rearrange your code.
Instead of turning the iterator into an assembly language function and call this function
from within the for loop body, this code would turn the <code>for</code> loop body into a
function, expand the iterator in-line (much like a macro) and call the <code>for</code>
loop body function on each <code>yield</code>. That is, Professional Pascal would probably
produce assembly language that looks something like the following:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">; The following procedure corresponds to the for loop body
; with a single parameter (I) corresponding to the loop
; control variable:

ForLoopCode     proc    near
                push    bp
                mov     bp, sp
                mov     ax, [bp+4]      ;Get loop control value and
                puti                    ; print it.
                putcr
                pop     bp
                ret     2               ;Pop loop control value off stk.
ForLoopCode             endp

; The follow code would be emitted in-line upon encountering the
; for loop in the main program, it corresponds to an in-line 
; expansion of the iterator as though it were a macro, 
; substituting a call for the yield instructions:

                push    1               ;On 286 and later processors only.
                call    ForLoopCode
                push    2
                call    ForLoopCode
                push    3
                call    ForLoopCode
                push    4
                call    ForLoopCode</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This method for implementing iterators is convenient and
produces relatively efficient (fast) code. It does, however, suffer from a couple
drawbacks. First, since you must expand the iterator in-line wherever you call it, much
like a macro, your program could grow large if the iterator is not short and you use it
often. Second, this method of implementing the iterator completely hides the underlying
logic of the code and makes your assembly language programs difficult to read and
understand.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="3"><a NAME="HEADING6-111"></a>12.5.2 Implementing
Iterators with Resume Frames</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In-line expansion is not the only way to implement
iterators. There is another method that preserves the structure of your program at the
expense of a slightly more complex implementation. Several high level languages, including
Icon and CLU, use this implementation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To start with, you will need another stack frame: the
resume frame. A resume frame contains two entries: a yield return address (that is, the
address of the next instruction after the <code>yield</code> statement) and a dynamic
link, which is a pointer to the iterator's activation record. Typically the dynamic link
is just the value in the <code>bp</code> register at the time you execute the <code>yield</code>
instruction. This version implements the four parts of an iterator as follows:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) A <code>call</code> instruction for the initial iterator
call, </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">2) A <code>call</code> instruction for the <code>yield</code>
statement, </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">3) A <code>ret</code> instruction for the resume operation,
and </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">4) A <code>ret</code> instruction to terminate the
iterator. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To begin with, an iterator will require two return
addresses rather than the single return address you would normally expect. The first
return address appearing on the stack is the termination return address. The second return
address is where the subroutine transfers control on a yield operation. The calling code
must push these two return addresses upon initial invocation of the iterator. The stack,
upon initial entry into the iterator, should look something like this:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><img SRC="images/ch12a8.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH12/ch12a8.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="113"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As an example, consider the <code>Range</code> iterator
presented earlier. This iterator requires two parameters, a starting value and an ending
value:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">	foreach i in Range(1,10) do writeln(i);</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The code to make the initial call to the <code>Range</code>
iterator, producing a stack like the one above, could be the following:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                push    1                       ;Push start parameter value.
                push    10                      ;Push stop parameter value.
                push    offset ForDone          ;Push termination address.
                call    Range                   ;Pushes yield return address.</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">ForDone is the first statement immediately following the
foreach loop, that is, the instruction to execute when the iterator returns failure. The
foreach loop body must begin with the first instruction following the call to Range. At
the end of the foreach loop, rather than jumping back to the start of the loop, or calling
the iterator again, this code should just execute a ret instruction. The reason will
become clear in a moment. So the implementation of the above foreach statement could be
the following:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">                push    1                       ;Obviously, this requires a
                push    10                      ; 80286 or later processor.
                push    offset ForDone
                call    Range
                mov     bp, [bp]                ;Explained a little later.
                puti
                putcr
                ret
ForDone:</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Granted, this doesn't look anything at all like a loop.
However, by playing some major tricks with the stack, you'll see that this code really
does iterate the loop body (puti and putcr) as intended.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now consider the Range iterator itself, here's the code to
do the job:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">Range_Start     equ     word ptr &lt;[bp+8]&gt;       ;Address of Start parameter.
Range_Stop      equ     word ptr &lt;[bp+6]&gt;       ;Address of Stop parameter.
Range_Yield     equ     word ptr &lt;[bp+2]&gt;       ;Yield return address.

Range           proc    near
                push    bp
                mov     bp, sp
RangeLoop:      mov     ax, Range_Start         ;Get start parameter and
                cmp     ax, Range_Stop          ; compare against stop.
                ja      RangeDone               ;Terminate if start &gt; stop

; Okay, build the resume frame:

                push    bp                      ;Save dynamic link.
                call    Range_Yield             ;Do YIELD operation.
                pop     bp                      ;Restore dynamic link.
                inc     Range_Start             ;Bump up start value
                jmp     RangeLoop               ;Repeat until start &gt; stop.

RangeDone:      pop     bp                      ;Restore old BP
                add     sp, 2                   ;Pop YIELD return address
                ret     4                       ;Terminate iterator.
Range           endp</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although this routine is rather short, don't let its size
deceive you; it's quite complex. The best way to describe how this iterator operates is to
take it a few instructions at a time. The first two instructions are the standard entry
sequence for a procedure. Upon execution of these two instructions, the stack looks like:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><img SRC="images/ch12a9.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH12/ch12a9.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="229" HEIGHT="187"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The next three statements in the <code>Range</code>
iterator, at label <code>RangeLoop</code>, implement the termination test of the while
loop. When the <code>Start</code> parameter contains a value greater than the <code>Stop</code>
parameter, control transfers to the <code>RangeDone</code> label at which point the code
pops the value of <code>bp</code> off the stack, pops the yield return address off the
stack (since this code will not return back to the body of the iterator loop) and then
returns via the termination return address that is immediately above the yield return
address on the stack. The return instruction also pops the two parameters off the stack.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The real work of the iterator occurs in the body of the
while loop. The <code>push</code>, <code>call</code>, and <code>pop</code> instructions
implement the yield statement. The <code>push</code> and <code>call</code> instructions
build the resume frame and then return control to the body of the foreach loop. The call
instruction is not calling a subroutine. What it is really doing here is finishing off the
resume frame (by storing the yield resume address into the resume frame) and then it
returns control back to the body of the <code>foreach</code> loop by jumping indirect
through the yield return address pushed on the stack by the initial call to the iterator.
After the execution of this call, the stack frame looks like:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also note that the <code>ax</code> register contains the
return value for the iterator. As with functions, <code>ax</code> is a good place to
return the iterator return result.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Immediately after yielding back to the <code>foreach</code>
loop, the code must reload <code>bp</code> with the original value prior to the iterator
invocation. This allows the calling code to correctly access parameters and local
variables in its own activation record rather than the activation record of the iterator.
Since <code>bp</code> just happens to point at the original <code>bp</code> value for the
calling code, executing the <code>mov bp, [bp] </code>instruction reloads <code>bp</code>
as appropriate. Of course, in this example reloading <code>bp</code> isn't necessary
because the body of the foreach loop does not reference any memory locations off the <code>bp</code>
register, but in general you will need to restore <code>bp</code>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the end of the foreach loop body the <code>ret</code>
instruction resumes the iterator. The <code>ret</code> instruction pops the return address
off the stack which returns control back to the iterator immediately after the call. The
instruction at this point pops <code>bp</code> off the stack, increments the <code>Start</code>
variable, and then repeats the while loop.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Of course, this is a lot of work to create a piece of code
that simply repeats a loop ten times. A simple for loop would have been much easier and
quite a bit more efficient that the foreach implementation described in this section. This
section used the <code>Range</code> iterator because it was easy to show how iterators
work using <code>Range</code>, not because actually implementing <code>Range</code> as an
iterator is a good idea.</font></p>
