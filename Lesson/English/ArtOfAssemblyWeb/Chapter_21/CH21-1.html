<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The original IBM PC design provided support for three
parallel printer ports that IBM designated LPT1:, LPT2:, and LPT3:<a HREF="#FOOTNOTE-1">[1]</a>.
IBM probably envisioned machines that could support a standard dot matrix printer, a daisy
wheel printer, and maybe some other auxiliary type of printer for different purposes, all
on the same machine (laser printers were still a few years in the future at that time).
Surely IBM did not anticipate the general use that parallel ports have received or they
would probably have designed them differently. Today, the PC's parallel port controls
keyboards, disk drives, tape drives, SCSI adapters, ethernet (and other network) adapters,
joystick adapters, auxiliary keypad devices, other miscellaneous devices, and, oh yes,
printers. This chapter will not attempt to describe how to use the parallel port for all
these various purposes - this book is long enough already. However, a thorough discussion
of how the parallel interface controls a printer and one other application of the parallel
port (cross machine communication) should provide you with enough ideas to implement the
next great parallel device.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are two basic data transmission methods modern
computes employ: parallel data transmission and serial data transmission. In a serial data
transmission scheme one device sends data to another a single bit at a time across one
wire. In a parallel transmission scheme, one device sends data to another several bits at
a time (in parallel) on several different wires. For example, the PC's parallel port
provides eight data lines compared to the serial port's single data line. Therefore, it
would seem that the parallel port would be able to transmit data eight times as fast since
there are eight times as many wires in the cable. Likewise, it would seem that a serial
cable, for the same price as a parallel cable, would be able to go eight times as far
since there are fewer wires in the cable. And these are the common trade-offs typically
given for parallel vs. serial communication methods: speed vs. cost.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In practice, parallel communications is not eight times
faster than serial communications, nor do parallel cables cost eight times as much. In
generally, those who design serial cables (.e.g, ethernet cables) use higher materials and
shielding. This raises the cost of the cable, but allows devices to transmit data, still a
bit at a time, much faster. Furthermore, the better cable design allows greater distances
between devices. Parallel cables, on the other hand, are generally quite inexpensive and
designed for very short connections (generally no more than about six to ten feet). The
real world problems of electrical noise and cross-talk create problems when using long
parallel cables and limit how fast the system can transmit data. In fact the original
Centronics printer port specification called for no more than 1,000 characters/second data
transmission rate, so many printers were designed to handle data at this transmission
rate. Most parallel ports can easily outperform this value; however, the limiting factor
is still the cable, not any intrinsic limitation in a modern computer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although a parallel communication system could use any
number of wires to transmit data, most parallel systems use eight data lines to transmit a
byte at a time. There are a few notable exceptions. For example, the SCSI interface is a
parallel interface, yet newer versions of the SCSI standard allow eight, sixteen, and even
thirty-two bit data transfers. In this chapter we will concentrate on byte-sized transfers
since the parallel port on the PC provides for eight-bit data.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A typical parallel communication system can be one way (or
unidirectional ) or two way (bidirectional ). The PC's parallel port generally supports
unidirectional communications (from the PC to the printer), so we will consider this
simpler case first.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In a unidirectional parallel communication system there are
two distinguished sites: the transmitting site and the receiving site. The transmitting
site places its data on the data lines and informs the receiving site that data is
available; the receiving site then reads the data lines and informs the transmitting site
that it has taken the data. Note how the two sites synchronize their access to the data
lines - the receiving site does not read the data lines until the transmitting site tells
it to, the transmitting site does not place a new value on the data lines until the
receiving site removes the data and tells the transmitting site that it has the data.
Handshaking is the term that describes how these two sites coordinate the data transfer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To properly implement handshaking requires two additional
lines. The strobe (or data strobe) line is what the transmitting site uses to tell the
receiving site that data is available. The acknowledge line is what the receiving site
uses to tell the transmitting site that it has taken the data and is ready for more. The
PC's parallel port actually provides a third handshaking line, busy, that the receiving
site can use to tell the transmitting site that it is busy and the transmitting site
should not attempt to send data. A typical data transmission session looks something like
the following:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Transmitting site:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) The transmitting site checks the busy line to see if the
receiving is busy. If the busy line is active, the transmitter waits in a loop until the
busy line becomes inactive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">2) The transmitting site places its data on the data lines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">3) The transmitting site activates the strobe line.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">4) The transmitting site waits in a loop for the
acknowledge line to become active.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">5) The transmitting site sets the strobe inactive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">6) The transmitting site waits in a loop for the
acknowledge line to become inactive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">7) The transmitting site repeats steps one through six for
each byte it must transmit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Receiving site:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) The receiving site sets the busy line inactive (assuming
it is ready to accept data).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">2) The receiving site waits in a loop until the strobe line
becomes active.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">3) The receiving site reads the data from the data lines
(and processes the data, if necessary).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">4) The receiving site activates the acknowledge line.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">5) The receiving site waits in a loop until the strobe line
goes inactive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">6) The receiving site sets the acknowledge line inactive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">7) The receiving site repeats steps one through six for
each additional byte it must receive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By carefully following these steps, the receiving and
transmitting sites carefully coordinate their actions so the transmitting site doesn't
attempt to put several bytes on the data lines before the receiving site consumes them and
the receiving site doesn't attempt to read data that the transmitting site has not sent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bidirectional data transmission is often nothing more than
two unidirectional data transfers with the roles of the transmitting and receiving sites
reversed for the second communication channel. Some PC parallel ports (particularly on
PS/2 systems and many notebooks) provide a bidirectional parallel port. Bidirectional data
transmission on such hardware is slightly more complex than on systems that implement
bidirectional communication with two unidirectional ports. Bidirectional communication on
a bidirectional parallel port requires an extra set of control lines so the two sites can
determine who is writing to the common data lines at any one time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Note that the parallel port provides 12 output lines (eight
data lines, strobe, autofeed, init, and select input) and five input lines (acknowledge,
busy, out of paper, select, and error). Even though the port is unidirectional, there is a
good mixture of input and output lines available on the port. Many devices (like disk and
tape drives) that require bidirectional data transfer use these extra lines to perform
bidirectional data transfer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On bidirectional parallel ports (found on PS/2 and laptop
systems), the strobe and data lines are both input and output lines. There is a bit in a
control register associated with the parallel port that selects the transfer direction at
any one given instant (you cannot transfer data in both direction simultaneously).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are three I/O addresses associated with a typical PC
compatible parallel port. These addresses belong to the data register, the status
register, and the control register. The data register is an eight-bit read/write port.
Reading the data register (in a unidirectional mode) returns the value last written to the
data register. The control and status registers provide the interface to the other I/O
lines. The organization of these ports is as follows:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img SRC="images/CH21-1-image-1.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH21/CH21-1-image-1.gif" WIDTH="401" HEIGHT="164"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bit two (printer acknowledge) is available only on PS/2 and
other systems that support a bidirectional printer port. Other systems do not use this
bit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img SRC="images/CH21-1-image-2.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH21/CH21-1-image-2.gif" WIDTH="397" HEIGHT="172"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The parallel port control register is an output register.
Reading this location returns the last value written to the control register except for
bit five that is write only. Bit five, the data direction bit, is available only on PS/2
and other systems that support a bidirectional parallel port. If you write a zero to this
bit, the strobe and data lines are output bits, just like on the unidirectional parallel
port. If you write a one to this bit, then the data and strobe lines are inputs. Note that
in the input mode (bit 5 = 1), bit zero of the control register is actually an input.
Note: writing a one to bit four of the control register enables the printer IRQ (IRQ 7).
However, this feature does not work on all systems so very few programs attempt to use
interrupts with the parallel port. When active, the parallel port will generate an int 0Fh
whenever the printer acknowledges a data transmission.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since the PC supports up to three separate parallel ports,
there could be as many as three sets of these parallel port registers in the system at any
one time. There are three parallel port base addresses associated with the three possible
parallel ports: 3BCh, 378h, and 278h. We will refer to these as the base addresses for
LPT1:, LPT2:, and LPT3:, respectively. The parallel port data register is always located
at the base address for a parallel port, the status register appears at the base address
plus one, and the control register appears at the base address plus two. For example, for
LPT1:, the data register is at I/O address 3BCh, the status register is at I/O address
3BDh, and the control register is at I/O address 3BEh.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is one minor glitch. The I/O addresses for LPT1:,
LPT2:, and LPT3: given above are the physical addresses for the parallel ports. The BIOS
provides logical addresses for these parallel ports as well. This lets users remap their
printers (since most software only writes to LPT1:). To accomplish this, the BIOS reserves
eight bytes in the BIOS variable space (40:8, 40:0A, 40:0C, and 40:0E). Location 40:8
contains the base address for logical LPT1:, location 40:0A contains the base address for
logical LPT2:, etc. When software accesses LPT1:, LPT2:, etc., it generally accesses the
parallel port whose base address appears in one of these locations.</font></p>
