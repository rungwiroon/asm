<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since there are an infinite variety of boolean functions of
n variables, but only a finite number of unique boolean functions of those n variables,
you might wonder if there is some method that will simplify a given boolean function to
produce the optimal form. Of course, you can always use algebraic transformations to
produce the optimal form, but using heuristics does not guarantee an optimal
transformation. There are, however, two methods that will reduce a given boolean function
to its optimal form: the map method and the prime implicants method. In this text we will
only cover the mapping method, see any text on logic design for other methods.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since for any logic function some optimal form must exist,
you may wonder why we don't use the optimal form for the canonical form. There are two
reasons. First, there may be several optimal forms. They are not guaranteed to be unique.
Second, it is easy to convert between the canonical and truth table forms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Using the <a NAME="MARKER-2-65"></a><a NAME="MARKER-2-66"></a><a NAME="MARKER-2-67"></a>map method to optimize boolean functions is practical only for
functions of two, three, or four variables. With care, you can use it for functions of
five or six variables, but the map method is cumbersome to use at that point. For more
than six variables, attempting map simplifications by hand would not be wise.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The first step in using the map method is to build a
two-dimensional truth table for the function:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a0.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a0.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="278" HEIGHT="331"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Warning: Take a careful look at these truth
tables. They do not use the same forms appearing earlier in this chapter. In particular,
the progression of the values is 00, 01, 11, 10, not 00, 01, 10, 11. This is very
important! If you organize the truth tables in a binary sequence, the mapping optimization
method will not work properly. We will call this a truth map to distinguish it from the
standard truth table.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><a NAME="MARKER-2-68"></a>Assuming your
boolean function is in canonical form (sum of minterms), insert ones for each of the truth
map entries corresponding to a minterm in the function. Place zeros everywhere else. For
example, consider the function of three variables <code>F=C'B'A + C'BA' + C'BA + CB'A' +
CB'A + CBA' + CBA.</code> The figure below shows the truth map for this function.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The next step is to draw rectangles around
rectangular groups of ones. The rectangles you enclose must have sides whose lengths are
powers of two. For functions of three variables, the rectangles can have sides whose
lengths are one, two, and four. The set of rectangles you draw must surround all cells
containing ones in the truth map. The trick is to draw all possible rectangles unless a
rectangle would be completely enclosed within another. Note that the rectangles may
overlap if one does not enclose the other. In the truth map below there are three such
rectangles:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a1.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a1.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="187" HEIGHT="109"><br>
<img SRC="images/ch02a2.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a2.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="123"> </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Each rectangle represents a term in the simplified boolean
function. Therefore, the simplified boolean function will contain only three terms. You
build each term using the process of elimination. You eliminate any variables whose primed
and unprimed form both appear within the rectangle. Consider the long skinny rectangle
above that is sitting in the row where C=1. This rectangle contains both A and B in primed
and unprimed form. Therefore, we can eliminate A and B from the term. Since the rectangle
sits in the C=1 region, this rectangle represents the single literal C. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now consider the solid square above. This rectangle
includes C, C', B, B' and A. Therefore, it represents the single term A. Likewise, the
square with the dotted line above contains C, C', A, A' and B. Therefore, it represents
the single term B. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The final, optimal, function is the sum (logical OR) of the
terms represented by the three squares. Therefore, <code>F= A + B + C</code>. You do not
have to consider squares containing zeros.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When enclosing groups of ones in the truth map, you must
consider the fact that a truth map forms a torus (i.e., a doughnut shape). The right edge
of the map wraps around to the left edge (and vice-versa). Likewise, the top edge wraps
around to the bottom edge. This introduces additional possibilities when surrounding
groups of ones in a map. Consider the boolean function <code>F=C'B'A' + C'BA' + CB'A' +
CBA'</code>. The figure below shows the truth map for this function.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a3.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a3.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="181" HEIGHT="109"> </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At first glance, you would think that there are two
possible rectangles here as the figure below shows. </font></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a4.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a4.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="87"> </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, because the truth map is a continuous object with
the right side and left sides connected, we can form a single, square rectangle, as shown
below:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a5.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a5.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="87"> </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So what? Why do we care if we have one rectangle or two in
the truth map? The answer is because the larger the rectangles are, the more terms they
will eliminate. The fewer rectangles that we have, the fewer terms will appear in the
final boolean function. For example, the former example with two rectangles generates a
function with two terms. The first rectangle (on the left) eliminates the C variable,
leaving A'B' as its term. The second rectangle, on the right, also eliminates the C
variable, leaving the term BA'. Therefore, this truth map would produce the equation
F=A'B' + A'B. We know this is not optimal, see Th 13. Now consider the second truth map
above. Here we have a single rectangle so our boolean function will only have a single
term. Obviously this is more optimal than an equation with two terms. Since this rectangle
includes both C and C' and also B and B', the only term left is A'. This boolean function,
therefore, reduces to F=A'.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There are only two cases that the truth map method cannot
handle properly: a truth map that contains all zeros or a truth map that contains all
ones. These two cases correspond to the boolean functions F=0 and F=1, respectively. These
functions are easy to generate by inspection of the truth map.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">An important thing you must keep in mind when optimizing
boolean functions using the mapping method is that you always want to pick the largest
rectangles whose sides' lengths are a power of two. You must do this even for overlapping
rectangles (unless one rectangle encloses another). Consider the boolean function <code>F
= C'B'A' + C'BA' + CB'A' + C'AB + CBA' + CBA. </code>This produces the truth map appearing
below:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a6.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a6.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="96"> </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The initial temptation is to create one of the sets of
rectangles found below:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a7.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a7.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="339" HEIGHT="86"> </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the correct mapping is</font></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a8.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a8.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="86"> </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">All three mappings will produce a boolean function with two
terms. However, the first two will produce the expressions <code>F= B + A'B' </code>and <code>F
= AB + A'</code>. The third form produces<code> F = B + A'</code>. Obviously, this last
form is more optimal than the other two forms (see theorems 11 and 12).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For functions of three variables, the size of the rectangle
determines the number of terms it represents: </font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A rectangle enclosing a single square represents a minterm.
    The associated term will have three literals.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A rectangle surrounding two squares containing ones
    represents a term containing two literals.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A rectangle surrounding four squares containing ones
    represents a term containing a single literal.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A rectangle surrounding eight squares represents the
    function F = 1. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Truth maps you create for functions of four variables are
even trickier. This is because there are lots of places rectangles can hide from you along
the edges. The Figures below show some possible places rectangles can hide.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a9.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a9.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="374" HEIGHT="82"><img SRC="images/ch02a10.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a10.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="371" HEIGHT="82"></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a11.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a11.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="371" HEIGHT="82"><img SRC="images/ch02a12.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a12.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="371" HEIGHT="82"></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a13.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a13.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="374" HEIGHT="82"><img SRC="images/ch02a14.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a14.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="374" HEIGHT="82"></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This list of patterns doesn't even begin to cover all of
them! For example, these diagrams show none of the 1x2 rectangles. You must exercise care
when working with four variable maps to ensure you select the largest possible rectangles,
especially when overlap occurs. This is particularly important with you have a rectangle
next to an edge of the truth map.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As with functions of three variables, the size of the
rectangle in a four variable truth map controls the number of terms it represents: </font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A rectangle enclosing a single square represents a minterm.
    The associated term will have four literals.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A rectangle surrounding two squares containing ones
    represents a term containing three literals.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A rectangle surrounding four squares containing ones
    represents a term containing two literals.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A rectangle surrounding eight squares containing ones
    represents a term containing a single literal.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">A rectangle surrounding sixteen squares represents the
    function F=1. </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This last example demonstrates an optimization of a
function containing four variables. The function is <code>F = D'C'B'A' + D'C'B'A + D'C'BA
+ D'C'BA' + D'CB'A + D'CBA + DCB'A + DCBA + DC'B'A' + DC'BA'</code>, the truth map appears
below:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a15.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a15.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="165" HEIGHT="93"> </p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are two possible sets of maximal rectangles for this
function, each producing three terms </font></p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="images/ch02a16.gif" tppabs="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/asm/ArtofAssembly/CH02/CH02a16.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH="295" HEIGHT="107"></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Both functions are equivalent; both are as
optimal as you can get. Either will suffice for our purposes.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">First, let's consider the term represented by
the rectangle formed by the four corners. This rectangle contains B, B', D, and D'; so we
can eliminate those terms. The remaining terms contained within these rectangles are C'
and A', so this rectangle represents the term C'A'. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The second rectangle, common to both maps in
the figure, is the rectangle formed by the middle four squares. This rectangle includes
the terms A, B, B', C, D, and D'. Eliminating B, B', D, and D' (since both primed and
unprimed terms exist), we obtain CA as the term for this rectangle.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The map on the left in the figurehas a third
term represented by the top row. This term includes the variables A, A', B, B', C' and D'.
Since it contains A, A', B, and B', we can eliminate these terms. This leaves the term
C'D'. Therefore, the function represented by the map on the left is <code>F=C'A' + CA +
C'D'.</code></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The map on the right in the figure has a third
term represented by the top/middle four squares. This rectangle subsumes the variables A,
B, B', C, C', and D'. We can eliminate B, B', C, and C' since both primed and unprimed
versions appear, this leaves the term AD. Therefore, the function represented by the
function on the right is F=<code>C'A' + CA + </code>AD'. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Since both expressions are equivalent, contain
the same number of terms, and the same number of operators, either form is equivalent.
Unless there is another reason for choosing one over the other, you can use either form. </font></p>
