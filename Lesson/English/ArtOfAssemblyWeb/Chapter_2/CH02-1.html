<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a NAME="MARKER-9-5"></a>Logic circuits are the basis for
modern digital computer systems. To appreciate how computer systems operate you will need
to understand digital logic and boolean algebra. This Chapter provides only a basic
introduction to boolean algebra. This subject alone is often the subject of an entire
textbook. This Chapter will concentrate on those subject that support other chapters in
this text.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Boolean logic forms the basis for computation in modern
binary computer systems. You can represent any algorithm, or any electronic computer
circuit, using a system of boolean equations. This chapter provides a brief introduction
to boolean algebra, truth tables, canonical representation, of boolean functions, boolean
function simplification, logic design, combinatorial and sequential circuits, and
hardware/software equivalence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The material is especially important to those who want to
design electronic circuits or write software that controls electronic circuits. Even if
you never plan to design hardware or write software than controls hardware, the
introduction to boolean algebra this chapter provides is still important since you can use
such knowledge to optimize certain complex conditional expressions within IF, WHILE, and
other conditional statements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The section on minimizing (optimizing) logic functions uses
Veitch Diagrams or Karnaugh Maps. The optimizing techniques this chapter uses reduce the
number of terms in a boolean function. You should realize that many people consider this
optimization technique obsolete because reducing the number of terms in an equation is not
as important as it once was. This chapter uses the mapping method as an example of boolean
function optimization, not as a technique one would regularly employ. If you are
interested in circuit design and optimization, you will need to consult a text on logic
design for better techniques.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although this chapter is mainly hardware-oriented, keep in
mind that many concepts in this text will use boolean equations (logic functions).
Likewise, some programming exercises later in this text will assume this knowledge.
Therefore, you should be able to deal with boolean functions before proceeding in this
text.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Boolean algebra is a deductive mathematical system closed
over the values zero and one (false and true). A <a NAME="MARKER-2-9"></a>binary operator
&quot;&quot; defined over this set of values accepts a pair of boolean inputs and produces
a single boolean value. For example, the boolean AND operator accepts two boolean inputs
and produces a single boolean output (the logical AND of the two inputs).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For any given algebra system, there are some initial
assumptions, or postulates, that the system follows. You can deduce additional rules,
theorems, and other properties of the system from this basic set of postulates. Boolean
algebra systems often employ the following postulates: </font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2"><a NAME="MARKER-2-10"></a>Closure<a NAME="MARKER-2-11"></a>.
    The boolean system is closed with respect to a binary operator if for every pair of
    boolean values, it produces a boolean result. For example, logical AND is closed in the
    boolean system because it accepts only boolean operands and produces only boolean results.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Commutativity<a NAME="MARKER-2-13"></a>. A binary operator
    &quot;%&quot; is said to be commutative if <code>AB = BA</code> for all possible boolean

</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Associativity<a NAME="MARKER-2-15"></a>. A binary operator

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(i.e., B is the opposite value of A in a boolean system). </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For our purposes, we will base boolean algebra on the
following set of operators and values:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The two possible values in the boolean system are zero and
one. Often we will call these values false and true (respectively).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The symbol &quot;&quot; represents the logical AND<a NAME="MARKER-2-20"></a><a NAME="MARKER-2-21"></a> operation; e.g., <code>A B</code> is the
result of logically ANDing the boolean values <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. When
using single letter variable names, this text will drop the &quot;&quot; symbol;
Therefore, <code>AB</code> also represents the logical AND of the variables <code>A</code>
and <code>B </code>(we will also call this the product of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The symbol &quot;+&quot; represents the logical OR
operation<a NAME="MARKER-2-22"></a><a NAME="MARKER-2-23"></a>; e.g., A + B is the result
of logically ORing the boolean values <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. (We will also
call this the sum of <code>A</code> and <code>B.)</code></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a NAME="MARKER-2-24"></a>Logical complement, negation, or
not, is a unary operator. This text will use the (<code>'</code>) symbol to denote logical
negation. For example, <code>A'</code> denotes the logical NOT of <code>A</code>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If several different operators appear in a single boolean
expression, the result of the expression depends on the precedence of the operators. We'll
use the following precedences (from highest to lowest) for the boolean operators:
parenthesis, logical NOT, logical AND, then logical OR. The logical AND and OR operators
are left associative. If two operators with the same precedence are adjacent, you must
evaluate them from left to right. The logical NOT operation is right associative, although
it would produce the same result using left or right associativity since it is a unary
operator.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We will also use the following set of postulates:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">P1 Boolean algebra is closed under the AND, OR, and NOT
operations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">P2 The identity element with respect to is one and + is
zero. There is no identity element with respect to logical NOT.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">P3 The and + operators are commutative.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">P4 and + are distributive with respect to one another. That
is, <code>A (B + C) = (A B) + (A C)</code> and <code>A + (B C) = (A + B) (A + C).</code></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">P5 For every value <code>A</code> there exists a value <code>A'</code>
such that <code>AA' = </code>0 and <code>A+A' = 1.</code> This value is the logical
complement (or NOT) of A.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">P6 and + are both associative. That is, <code>(AB)C = A(BC)
</code>and<code> (A+B)+C = A+(B+C)</code>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can prove all other theorems in boolean algebra using
these postulates. This text will not go into the formal proofs of these theorems, however,
it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with some important theorems in boolean algebra.
A sampling include:<a NAME="MARKER-2-26"></a><a NAME="MARKER-2-27"></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th1: A + A = A</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th2: A A = A</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th3: A + 0 = A</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th4: A 1 = A</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th5: A 0 = 0</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th6: A + 1 = 1</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th7: (A + B)' = A' B' </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th8: (A B)' = A' + B'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th9: A + AB = A</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th10: A (A + B) = A</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th11: A + A'B = A+B</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th12: A' (A + B') = A'B'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th13: AB + AB' = A</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th14: (A'+B') (A' + B) = A'</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th15: A + A' = 1</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Th16: A A' = 0</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Theorems seven and eight above are known as DeMorgan's
Theorems after the mathematician who discovered them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The theorems above appear in pairs. Each pair (e.g., Th1
&amp; Th2, Th3 &amp; Th4, etc.) form a dual. An important principle in the boolean algebra
system is that of duality<a NAME="MARKER-2-28"></a><a NAME="MARKER-2-29"></a>. Any valid
expression you can create using the postulates and theorems of boolean algebra remains
valid if you interchange the operators and constants appearing in the expression.
Specifically, if you exchange the and + operators and swap the 0 and 1 values in an
expression, you will wind up with an expression that obeys all the rules of boolean
algebra. This does not mean the dual expression computes the same values, it only means
that both expressions are legal in the boolean algebra system. Therefore, this is an easy
way to generate a second theorem for any fact you prove in the boolean algebra system. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although we will not be proving any theorems for the sake
of boolean algebra in this text, we will use these theorems to show that two boolean
equations are identical. This is an important operation when attempting to produce
canonical representations of a boolean expression or when simplifying a boolean
expression.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A boolean expression is a sequence of zeros, ones, and
literals separated by boolean operators. A literal is a primed (negated) or unprimed
variable name. For our purposes, all variable names will be a single alphabetic character.
A boolean function is a specific boolean expression; we will generally give boolean
functions the name &quot;F&quot; with a possible subscript. For example, consider the
following boolean:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Courier New" size="2"><code>F0 = AB+C</code></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This function computes the logical AND of A and B and then
logically ORs this result with C. If A=1, B=0, and C=1, then F0 returns the value one (10
+ 1 = 1).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another way to represent a boolean function is via a truth
table. The previous chapter used truth tables to represent the AND and OR functions. Those
truth tables took the forms: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For binary operators and two input variables, this form of
a truth table is very natural and convenient. However, reconsider the boolean function F0
above. That function has three input variables, not two. Therefore, one cannot use the
truth table format given above. Fortunately, it is still very easy to construct truth
tables for three or more variables. The following example shows one way to do this for
functions of three or four variables: </font></p>

three separate functions of three variables. <a NAME="MARKER-2-33"></a><a NAME="MARKER-2-34"></a><a NAME="MARKER-2-35"></a>Although you can create an infinite
variety of boolean functions, they are not all unique. For example, F=A and F=AA are two
different functions. By theorem two, however, it is easy to show that these two functions
are equivalent, that is, they produce exactly the same outputs for all input combinations.
If you fix the number of input variables, there are a finite number of unique boolean
functions possible. For example, there are only 16 unique boolean functions with two
inputs and there are only 256 possible boolean functions of three input variables. Given n
input variables, there are 2**(2**n) (two raised to the two raised to the nth power)
unique boolean functions of those n input values. For two input variables, 2**(2**2) =
2**4 or 16 different functions. With three input variables there are 2**(2**3) = 2**8 or
256 possible functions. Four input variables create 2**(2**4) or 2**16, or 65,536
different unique boolean functions. <a NAME="MARKER-2-36"></a><a NAME="MARKER-2-37"></a>When

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a NAME="MARKER-2-38"></a>Beyond two input variables there
are too many functions to provide specific names. Therefore, we will refer to the
function's number rather than the function's name. For example, <code>F8</code> denotes
the logical AND of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> for a two-input function and <code>F</code>14
is the logical OR operation. Of course, the only problem is to determine a function's
number. For example, given the function of three variables <code>F=AB+C,</code> what is
the corresponding function number? This number is easy to compute by looking at the truth
table for the function (see <a HREF="#MARKER-9-4">Table 14</a>). If we treat the values
for <code>A, B, </code>and <code>C</code> as bits in a binary number with <code>C</code>
being the H.O. bit and <code>A</code> being the L.O. bit, they produce the binary numbers
in the range zero through seven. Associated with each of these binary strings is a zero or
one function result. If we construct a binary value by placing the function result in the
bit position specified by <code>A, B, </code>and <code>C</code>, the resulting binary
number is that function's number. Consider the truth table for <code>F=AB+C</code>: CBA: 7
6 5 4 3 2 1 0 F=AB+C : 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 If we treat the function values for <code>F</code>
as a binary number, this produces the value F816 or 248 (decimal). We will usually denote
function numbers in decimal. This also provides the insight into why there are 2**(2**n)
different functions of n variables: if you have n input variables, there are 2**n bits in
function's number. If you have m bits, there are 2**m different values. Therefore, for n
input variables there are m=2**n possible bits and 2**m or 2**(2**n) possible functions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You can transform one boolean expression into an equivalent
expression by applying the postulates the theorems of boolean algebra. This is important
if you want to convert a given expression to a canonical form (a standardized form) or if
you want to minimize the number of literals (primed or unprimed variables) or terms in an
expression. Minimizing terms and expressions can be important because electrical circuits
often consist of individual components that implement each term or literal for a given
expression. Minimizing the expression allows the designer to use fewer electrical
components and, therefore, can reduce the cost of the system. Unfortunately, there are no
fixed rules you can apply to optimize a given expression. Much like constructing
mathematical proofs, an individual's ability to easily do these transformations is usually
a function of experience. Nevertheless, a few examples can show the possibilities: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since there are a finite number of boolean functions of n
input variables, yet an infinite number of possible logic expressions you can construct
with those n input values, clearly there are an infinite number of logic expressions that
are equivalent (i.e., they produce the same result given the same inputs). To help
eliminate possible confusion, logic designers generally specify a boolean function using a
canonical, or standardized, form. For any given boolean function there exists a unique
canonical form. This eliminates some confusion when dealing with boolean functions.
Actually, there are several different canonical forms. We will discuss only two here and
employ only the first of the two. <a NAME="MARKER-2-54"></a><a NAME="MARKER-2-55"></a>The
first is the so-called sum of minterms and the second is the product of maxterms. Using
the duality principle, it is very easy to convert between these two. A <a NAME="MARKER-2-56"></a><a NAME="MARKER-2-57"></a>term is a variable or a product (logical
AND) of several different literals. For example, if you have two variables, A and B, there
are eight possible terms: <code>A, B, A', B', A'B', A'B, AB', </code>and <code>AB</code>.
For three variables we have 26 different terms: A, B, C, A', B', C', <code>A'B', A'B, AB',
AB, A'C', A'C, AC', AC, B'C', B'C, BC', BC, A'B'C', AB'C', A'BC', ABC', A'B'C, AB'C, A'BC,
</code>and<code> ABC.</code> As you can see, as the number of variables increases, the
number of terms increases dramatically. A <a NAME="MARKER-2-59"></a>minterm is a product
containing exactly n literals. For example, the minterms for two variables are <code>A'B',
AB', A'B,</code> and <code>AB</code>. Likewise, the minterms for three variables <code>A,
B, </code>and <code>C</code> are <code>A'B'C', AB'C', A'BC', ABC', A'B'C, AB'C, A'BC, and
ABC</code>. In general, there are 2**n minterms for n variables. The set of possible
minterms is very easy to generate since they correspond to the sequence of binary numbers:

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We can specify any boolean function using a sum (logical
OR) of minterms. Given F248=AB+C the equivalent canonical form is
ABC+A'BC+AB'C+A'B'C+ABC'. Algebraically, we can show that these two are equivalent as
follows: </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">ABC+A'BC+AB'C+A'B'C+ABC'= BC(A+A') + B'C(A+A') + ABC'
                        = BC1 +B'C1 + ABC'

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Obviously, the canonical form is not the optimal form. On
the other hand, there is a big advantage to the sum of minterms canonical form: it is very
easy to generate the truth table for a function from this canonical form. Furthermore, it
is also very easy to generate the logic equation from the truth table. <a NAME="MARKER-2-60"></a>To build the truth table from the canonical form, simply convert
each minterm into a binary value by substituting a &quot;1&quot; for unprimed variables
and a &quot;0&quot; for primed variables. Then place a &quot;1&quot; in the corresponding
position (specified by the binary minterm value) in the truth table: 1) Convert minterms

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Going in the other direction, generating a logic function
from a truth table, is almost as easy. First, locate all the entries in the truth table
with a one. In the table above, these are the last five entries. The number of table
entries containing ones determines the number of minterms in the canonical equation. To
generate the individual minterms, substitute A, B, or C for ones and A', B', or C' for
zeros in the truth table above. Then compute the sum of these items. In the example above,
F248 contains one for CBA = 111, 110, 101, 100, and 011. Therefore, F248 = CBA + CBA' +
CB'A + CB'A' + C'AB. The first term, CBA, comes from the last entry in the table above. C,
B, and A all contain ones so we generate the minterm CBA (or ABC, if you prefer). The
second to last entry contains 110 for CBA, so we generate the minterm CBA'. Likewise, 101
produces CB'A; 100 produces CB'A', and 011 produces C'BA. Of course, the logical OR and
logical AND operations are both commutative, so we can rearrange the terms within the
minterms as we please and we can rearrange the minterms within the sum as we see fit. This
process works equally well for any number of variables. Consider the function F53504 =
ABCD + A'BCD + A'B'CD + A'B'C'D. Placing ones in the appropriate positions in the truth
table generates the following: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The remaining elements in this truth table all contain
zero. Perhaps the easiest way to generate the canonical form of a boolean function is to
first generate the truth table for that function and then build the canonical form from
the truth table. We'll use this technique, for example, when converting between the two
canonical forms this chapter presents. However, it is also a simple matter to generate the
sum of minterms form algebraically. By using the distributive law and theorem 15 (A + A' =
1) makes this task easy. Consider F248 = AB + C. This function contains two terms, AB and
C, but they are not minterms. Minterms contain each of the possible variables in a primed
or unprimed form. We can convert the first term to a sum of minterms as follows: </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">AB      =       AB  1           By Th4
        =       AB  (C + C')    By Th 15
        =       ABC + ABC'      By distributive law
        =       CBA + C'BA      By associative law</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Similarly, we can convert the second term in F248 to a sum
of minterms as follows: </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">C       =       C  1                          By Th4
        =       C  (A + A')                   By Th15
        =       CA + CA'                      By distributive law
        =       CA 1 + CA'1                   By Th4
        =       CA  (B + B') + CA'  (B + B')  By Th15
        =       CAB + CAB' + CA'B + CA'B'     By distributive law
        =       CBA + CBA' + CB'A + CB'A'     By associative law</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The last step (rearranging the terms) in these two
conversions is optional. To obtain the final canonical form for F248 we need only sum the
results from these two conversions: </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">F248    = (CBA + C'BA) + (CBA + CBA' + CB'A + CB'A')
        = CBA + CBA' + CB'A + CB'A' + C'BA</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another way to generate a canonical form is to use products
of maxterms. A maxterm is the sum (logical OR) of all input variables, primed or unprimed.
For example, consider the following logic function G of three variables:</font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">G = (A+B+C)  (A'+B+C)  (A+B'+C).</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Like the sum of minterms form, there is exactly one product
of maxterms for each possible logic function. Of course, for every product of maxterms
there is an equivalent sum of minterms form. In fact, the function G, above, is equivalent
to </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">F248 = CBA + CBA' + CB'A + CB'A' + C'BA = AB +C.</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Generating a truth table from the product of maxterms is no
more difficult than building it from the sum of minterms. You use the duality principle to
accomplish this. Remember, the duality principle says to swap AND for OR and zeros for
ones (and vice versa). Therefore, to build the truth table, you would first swap primed
and non-primed literals. In G above, this would yield: </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">G = (A' + B' + C')  (A + B' + C')  (A' + B + C')</font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The next step is to swap the logical OR and logical AND
operators. This produces </font></p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">G = A'B'C' + AB'C' + A'BC' </font></pre>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, you need to swap all zeros and ones. This means
that you store zeros into the truth table for each of the above entries and then fill in
the rest of the truth table with ones. This will place a zero in entries zero, one, and
two in the truth table. Filling the remaining entries with ones produces F248. <a NAME="MARKER-2-61"></a>You can easily convert between these two canonical forms by
generating the truth table for one form and working backwards from the truth table to
produce the other form. For example, consider the function of two variables, F7 = A + B.
The sum of minterms form is F7 = A'B + AB' + AB. The truth table takes the form: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Working backwards to get the product of maxterms, we locate
all entries that have a zero result. This is the entry with A and B equal to zero. This
gives us the first step of G=A'B'. However, we still need to invert all the variables to
obtain G=AB. By the duality principle we need to swap the logical OR and logical AND
operators obtaining G=A+B. This is the canonical product of maxterms form. Since working
with the product of maxterms is a little messier than working with sums of minterms, this
text will generally use the sum of minterms form. Furthermore, the sum of minterms form is
more common in boolean logic work. However, you will encounter both forms when studying
logic design.</font></p>
