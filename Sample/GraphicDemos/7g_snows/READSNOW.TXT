    a 256B intro for DemoBit'00 demo party

       (why would you rip it ? *grin*)

   dedicated to ELL, who knows why ...

 Firstly, this intro missed the party due to ignorant
Slovak car drivers, who didn't want to take me to party
place, thank you all very much. Now I'm releasing it
"just so" for your enjoyment, so enjoy it. Thanks. :)
 Anyway, don't forget to check out our winning demo FATE
from DB'00 party (delivered to party by the rest of our
crew, who liked to pay to our railways... ;)).

 System req: MS-DOS | Win9x/NT (dos-box) | anything
else, what is capable to load .COM file, emulate
MOV ax,13h INT 10h (MS-DOS 320x200x256color mode),
and will stay alive after full (A000:0000) ->
(A000:FFFF) memory rewrite. Yeah, and, well, about
280 bytes of free memory is needed. Quite a problem,
isn't it ? (if you don't have idea, how much 280
bytes are ... this PAGE of text has MUCH more...)
 I quite wonder about the WinNT ability to run this.
I didn't believe until my friend show me ...

 press some nice key to exit running intro.

 This M$ stuff forced me to almost leave ASCII
art dead in ".txt" files, so just a very simple
and ugly "snowshow" title ... (gimme back dos
fonts, damn, i wanna gfx. characters...)

 What else to write here... yeah, this intro
sux terribly, no idea, no taste, no chilli,
just another excellent piece of code... :(
 And this ugly flashing screen at the beginning
- I had about 22B left, when I finished second
round of size optim., so I added that shit, btw
it is quite short, so why not to show others,
that I can pack it all in 256B, yeah. superego.
 When I finished third round of size optim., I was
finaly capable to add "set_up_text_mode" and
"get_key_you_pushed" code, and also align some
code in inner loop. And I just wondered, where's
the limit ??? (I got about 8B more + 3B for alignment
when compared to second round result... 11B ! damn)
 Now you could exit the intro w/o any problems... :)

 Check source for nice random constant, I really
like it. And for other cool tricks...

 Finaly, I hope, that you haven't saw too many
snow-shows before ... it would be boring then(?).
 And I have to give credit to PAVUK. He has stolen
this effect from Amiga and converted it to ZX Spectrum
... and we didn't use it in any demo, so I decided
to reanimate this idea in 256B PC intro ... Who knows,
where that amiga guy got the idea ... (C64 ? *grin*)
