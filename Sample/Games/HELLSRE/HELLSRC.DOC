  This is the entire protected mode assembly source code to 'HELL' by Tran. It
can be compiled with TASM and TLINK. But in order to run it, you must have the
original demo 'HELL.EXE' because all the data is there.

To my fellow competent programmers: (Not too many of whom exist in Redmond)
  It is not terribly well optimized, but it serves the purpose. It is GUS
only (the demo requires timing from the muzik), but it would not be too hard
to write yourself a little SB mixer replacement for GS.ASM if you really felt
like it. Heres a breakdown of the files:

  PMODE.ASM   - My little protected mode extender thingy.
  FILE.ASM    - File library.
  FLIB.ASM    - Handles all files in a single file.
  KB.ASM      - Low level keyboard interface.
  VECT3.ASM   - Just a rotation thingy.
  DECODE0.ASM - Decompression code.
  GS.ASM      - Low level GUS interface.
  GSP669.ASM  - 669 player using GS.

  V.ASM       - Main demo file.
  P0.ASM      - Some parts of the demo.
  P1.ASM      - Some more parts of the demo.
  P2.ASM      - Even more parts of the demo.
  P3.ASM      - Still more parts of the demo.

  VRTIME.M    - Times the vertical retrace period using the system timer.
  END.M       - Puts up the end piccy.

There are a bunch of misc .RT files also, and ofcourse the .INC include files.

Greets to...
  All those who make the effort to learn ASM.
  Also to Arjan Brusse.
  And all other coders, artists, and muzicians. (But not organizers,
   organization sucks. It takes away from the phenomenon of the incredible
   self-modifying deadline.)

Hmm...
  Have you noticed the weird recent trend toward total global political and
   economic stability?¨? (Germany, Russia, Mid-East, Ireland, China)


                                                Whatever...
                                                Tran (a.k.a. Thomas Pytel)
                                                 of nothing.
