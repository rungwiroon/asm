If speed is a consideration then most of the converstion and string
functions should be of interest.  Also, some of the following:

  FD_INIT  and the fixed record lenght database system is faster
           than the variable lenght database system (DBASE_INIT).

  SCAN_BLOCK_FAST - a very fast search function.  Even faster than
           using the Intel string search instructions.

  MERGE_SORT - faster than the quick sort algrothm in some cases.

  COMPRESS   - the compress functions are all optimized for speed
               and rival some commerical products.

  DISPLAY - many of the display functions write directly to memory
            and are very fast.
