File HINTS.DOC

How do I find a function?

  The file SUMMARY.DOC is a good place to start looking.  If one
  of the sample programs uses similiar logic it is also a good
  source of information.  Finally, the source files are the final
  documentation and are named to indicate function groups.

How do I find more about a function?

  The SCAN program is ideal for seeing who uses a function and how.
  It also will find the source file, and any place the function is
  mentioned in the documentation.  For example:

     SCAN *.* dword_to_hex

  The above will find all dword to hex functions anywhere in the
  current directory.  To just search in the sample programs and
  source files use:

    SCAN *.asm dword_to_hex

How do I write simple programs without using the built in memory
manager.

  Using the TEMPLATE.ASM with its built in memory manager is the
  safest way to use ALIB, but isn't necessary.  The code timer
  is one of the sample programs and has an example of disabling
  the memory manager.  Some of the other sample programs borrow
  souce from library and do not make any library calls (CALC.ASM)
