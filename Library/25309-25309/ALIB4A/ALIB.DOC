        What is it?
        -------------

        ALIB is a (FREE) library of common functions needed by assembly
        language programmers.  Some of the functions included in
        ALIB are:

           * Database   * Compression   * Memory Manager
           * Menuing    * Floating Math * Hyper text
           * Windowing  * Hardware analysis

        This package consists of three zip files as follows:

          ALIB4a.ZIP - Library and Documentation
          ALIB4b.ZIP - Sample Programs
          ALIB4c.ZIP - Source files


        Why was it written?
        -------------------

        For years assembly language has been regarded as somewhat
        tedious and difficult, but its small size, unlimited
        freedom, and performance have kept it very much alive.
        This library attempts to remove some of the tedium by
        adding a set of high level functions to the programmers
        arsenal.  With ALIB it is possible to write DOS programs
        in a few minutes.


        What hardware and software is needed?
        -------------------------------------

        For use with IBM PS/2, XT, PC and compatibles with DOS 2.1
        or greater capability.  The following software will be
        needed to make use of ALIB:

        1.  Assembler for 8088,8086,80386, etc.  Known assemblers
            are:  A86 (Shareware), MASM (Microsoft), TASM
            (Borland), OPTASM (SLR Systems).

        2.  Linker to handle the .OBJ file produced by
            the assembler.  Linkers are usually sold
            with the assembler except in the case of
            A86.

        3.  Debugger for testing.  Many assemblers have
            a companion debugger which is sold separately.
            All of these debuggers are adequate.  The
            old standby DOS DEBUG program will work, but
            it needs symbolic capability for serious
            work.  The independently produced Periscope
            debuggers are also very good.
            

        How do I install it?
        --------------------

        To initially explore ALIB it is best to place it in a
        separate directory and work with it there.  No special
        installation process is necessary.  Eventually, the
        library itself (ALIB.LIB) can be placed in a common
        directory of assembly tools and the remaining files
        archived.

        What files make up ALIB4a.ZIP ?
        -------------------------------
    
        ALIB.LIB         Library of functions
        ALIB.DOC         General information
        SUMMARY.DOC      Summary of library functions 
        CALLS.DOC        Detailed description of library functions
        TEMPLATE.ASM     Sample format for most programs
        HINTS.DOC        How to use ALIB
        SAMPLE.DOC       Sample programs
        SPEED.DOC        Notes on performance
        COMMON.INC       Inputs for sample programs
        MAC.INC          Macros for sample programs
        FILE_ID.DIZ      Short description for BBS usage

        What files help with understanding ALIB?
        ----------------------------------------

        Assembly language programmers can get started by looking at
        TEMPLATE.ASM and then using SUMMARY.DOC, CALLS.DOC and the sample
        programs as reference maternal.  Novice programmers should probably
        execute the sample program called HYPER and study the material,
        then study the sample programs, starting with TEMPLATE.ASM.  
        

        Is registration necessary?
        --------------------------
         
        Registration of ALIB is not required for personal or
        commercial use.  However, ALIB will not grow and improve
        without some support.  If you have a useful piece of code
        or comment, please send it to the author for future updates.

        Can I distribute ALIB to others?
        --------------------------------

        You are free to distribute this program, provided that
        neither the program nor this document are changed, and the
        program and this document are kept together.  Only a
        marginal fee may be asked for shipment and handling when
        distributing.  You are not allowed to sell this program.
                 

        What if problems occur?
        -----------------------

        Problems?  What problems?  After two years of work no
        programmer wants to talk about problems.  But, the truth
        is that problems will occur.  Either the documentation
        will not be adequate, bugs will be found, or necessary
        features will be missing.  The answer to all these
        problems is the same, either discard ALIB or support it.
        My pledge is to support ALIB without any monetary gain as
        long as there is a reasonable interest level.

        Limitations:
        -------------

        ALIB is definitely not for everyone.  If you are interested in
        graphic screens, buttons, etc. then look elsewhere.  This
        library is not for graphic applications.  On the other
        hand, lack of graphics greatly increases compatibility,
        speed, and reduces code size.

        ALIB is not designed to be accessed from other languages.
        It is possible, but not advised.  The use of registers,
        memory, and display all are designed as if ALIB is the
        main program.

        ALIB is not designed for use with TSR (Terminate and
        Stay Resident) programs.  Most of the functions will
        work with TSR's but those calling the memory manager
        will not function.
        
        And last but not least, the documentation for ALIB is
        very breif and does not explain some of the more complicated
        functions in sufficient detail for all audiences.


        Future
        ------

        I would like ALIB to be NASM based in the future and utilize
        freeware links.  When time is available functions and programs
        will be rewritten and tested.  Others who are also interested in
        this are invited to email and share resources.

        Also, adapting some of this for LINUX is of interest.
