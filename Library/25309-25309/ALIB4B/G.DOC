G.EXE is a directory changer similiar to DOS's CHDRR command.  It
provides several novel features not found in previous directory
change prorams, including sorted directories, color coding, TSR
status, and memory status, etc., plus it is easy to use.  The
program GSETUP.EXE can be used to select amoung the features
desired.

The quickest way to see G.EXE in action is to type "G;" and look
at the displays.  Then execute GSETUP.EXE to see what can be configured.

Summary of parameters:

    Parameter                       Action
    ---------       ---------------------------------------------------
     none           G.EXE will move to root directory
      .             move back one directory
      ..            move back two directories
      ?             display help message
      +             Temp enable of all displays
      \             root request or optional path separator
      ;             stay in current directory after displaying status
    path fragment   input for G.EXE's path search logic
  

CHANGING DIRECTORIES USING -G.EXE-
  
  Path changes can be made using either a NEAR approach or a FAR approach.
  The near aproach requires only the partial name of the target directory
  but requires that the directory be within one level of present location.
  For example if the directory ALPHA is near then it can probably be reached
  by typeing "G A".
  The FAR approach views the disk from the root directory and trys to find
  the path from there. For example if you had a directory:
                \WINDOWS\ZIPS\GAMES
  Then the command to get there is "G W Z G" or G WI Z GA" or "G W Z GAM"
  etc.  The G.EXE program will always try to solve the puzzle you give it.

  The special characters "." can be used to move back one directory.  And
  the "\" character will move to the root if it is specified by itself.

------------------------------- GSETUP.EXE --------------------------------

The GSETUP.EXE program will configure G.EXE.  The setup
features are:

    1.  The colors of all displays and directory entries can be
        changed.
    2.  Each display type can be disabled or enabled
    3.  Sorting, Display speed and other flags can be changed.

Version 2.1 Additions:

  The TSR line was improved by adding a display of device drivers loaded.
  Drivers are displayed in lower case to differentiate between TSR's
  loaded low.  TSR's loaded high still have a seperate color.
