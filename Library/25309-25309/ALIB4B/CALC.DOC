Purpose:   CALC.COM is a small programmers pop up calculator.



Features:  CALC works with both hex and decimal numbers up to
           4294967295 decimal or ffffffffh hex.

           Numbers can be added,subtracted,divided,multiplied
           or converted.

           CALC uses only 840 bytes of memory.

           All results are shown in both hex and decimal.



Usage:     When CALC is executed it becomes resident and remains dormant
           until activated by entering ALT-Z.  Each time ALT-Z is pressed
           CALC will perform one calculation.   After the calculation is
           complete, the results will remain in the upper right area
           of display until scrolled off.   Data is entered as it would
           normally be written.  For example: to add 11 and 12 enter
           11+12 followed by Enter key.



Restrictions:

           In order to keep CALC as small as possible, several restrictions
           are necessary.  Only one calculation containing a maximum of two
           values can be performed each time CALC is activated.  Thus,
           only two number can be added or subtracted at a time.  
           Also, the cursor does not appear as data is entered, and error
           checking is minimal.



Examples:  For each of the following ALT-Z was pressed first.

           123456+1234h<enter>   <- adds 123456 decimal and 1234 hex

           123456/4<enter>       <- divides 123456 by 4

           123h<enter>           <- converts 123 hex to decimal

           123<enter>            <- converts 123 decimal to hex

           123h*123              <- multiply 123 hex by 123 decimal

           123h-123              <- subtract 123 decimal from 123 hex


Who needs it:

           CALC is designed for programmers who occasionally need a
           pop up calculator.  It does not
           handle decimal points or signed numbers, so non-programmers
           will not find it useful.  Also, programmers working
           in a high level language may not find it useful, so it is
           mainly of interest to assembly language programmers.


Why was it written:

           CALC was programmed by Jeff Owens to pop up over an
           editor.  The small size was needed so compliers could
           be executed without unloading resident programs first.
           This allowed the compiler to be executed from the
           editor.  CALC is not copyrighted and can be distributed
           freely.  Comments to Jeff Owens, 503-6302317
