DPMI.DOC


The STARTDP startup code switches the system into 32-bit protected mode
and calls your main program MAIN32.  Your program should be written using
my MODEL.INC, CODESEG.INC and DATASEG.INC include files as shown in my
dumb example HELLO32.ASM.  Most DOS functions work, the common BIOS functions
work too, with 32-bit addresses used in place of 16-bit addresses.

Memory allocation is most easily done with the GetMemNear, RelMemNear and
ResMemNear subroutines which Allocate, Free and Re-size near memory blocks,
respectively.  You will find these subroutines in the DPMI32.ASM source
code.

If you need to re-assemble the STARTDP source code, use TASM (NOT MASM)
and use the /m2 command-line switch.

Assemble your source code by copying or renaming the DPMI.INC file to
MODEL.INC and assemble normally with MASM 5.0 or newer, or TASM 2.0 or
newer.

Linking your program is simple:

TLINK /3 STARTDP+main32;

-or-

LINK STARTDP+main32;

A program made with STARTDP requires a DPMI host, such as Windows,
OS/2, 386MAX version 7 or newer, or QDPMI.
